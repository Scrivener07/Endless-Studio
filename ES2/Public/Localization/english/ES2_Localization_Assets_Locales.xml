  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly01Title">Garden of Eden</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly01Description">Lush and pleasant, with a single year-round season of moderate temperatures, life is good on this planet. Everyone benefits from its natural wealth: Residents, tourists, businessmen, and scientists.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly02Title">Dust Ruins</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly02Description">Many ruins from the time of the Endless were Dust-enhanced structures or traditional buildings that preceded the Dust era. On very rare occasions, however, one can find entire structures built uniquely from this valuable resource.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly03Title">Friendly Locals</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly03Description">Native inhabitants can be classified in one of two ways: those who view you as friends, and those who view you as dinner. Fortunately, this is the former case. By accelerating the colonists' adaptation to the local ecosystem, they permit a higher density of population than is common on a planet of this size.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly04Title">Rich Soil</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly04Description">The soil of this planet is rich in bacteria and nutrients; crops will grow well and livestock will be healthy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly05Title">Mineral Rich</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly05Description">Due to its formation from Dust clouds that spun off from the system's sun, the crust of this planet is unusually rich in minerals.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly06Title">Hadopelagic Life</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly06Description">Having deep oceans that are rich with life, this planet is abundant in hadopelagic creatures -- those that have adapted to the lightless environment at the bottom of the ocean and are tolerant of the tremendous pressures. They are not only a source of food, but provide useful scientific information on extremophilic life forms.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly07Title">Antonov Rings</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly07Description">Dense rings of beige and brown asteroids with erratic orbits, the planetary rings are fascinating for tourists and equally interesting for scientific studies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly08Title">Huygens Rings</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly08Description">A rich, multi-colored band of asteroids surrounds this planet. Reflecting the star's light in green, gray, purple, white, and blue, they are a highly prized tourist destination as well as a ready source of minerals and alloys.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly09Title">Hollow Planet</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly09Description">About as anomalous as an anomaly can be, this planet has vast subterranean spaces that are hundreds of cubic kilometers in size. Fascinating to tourists and scientists, it adds a great deal of habitable space that is highly defensible.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly10Title">Ice-10</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly10Description">A rare form of ice that is caused by water crystallizing under high pressures, Ice-10 is interesting for its thermodynamic properties. Its existence at only extremely low temperatures, however, means that the planet has a dangerous and hostile environment.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly10ReducedTitle">Ice-10</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly10ReducedDescription">A rare form of ice that is caused by water crystallizing under high pressures, Ice-10 is interesting for its thermodynamic properties. A concerted effort by the planet's engineers has led to a lessening of its negative effects.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly11Title">Permanent Monsoon</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly11Description">The good news: This is a water-rich planet and therefore of great value to agriculture. The bad news: This water is generally delivered horizontally in your face by gale-force winds. Tides and winds, fortunately, also provide ready sources of (wet) energy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly11ReducedTitle">Permanent Monsoon</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly11ReducedDescription">Once a very wet and very difficult environment, a concerted effort to partially terraform the planet has lessened the intensity of the winds and storms.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly12Title">Metallic Waters</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly12Description">Rich in deposits of copper, iron, zinc, and other metals, the lakes and geysers of this planet are stunning to behold. The high metal content of the waters is also a boon to industrial development, as highly purified ores can be obtained through simple filtration.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly12ReducedTitle">Metallic Waters</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly12ReducedDescription">Almost dirt-free, the hard, gleaming surface of this planet used to make agriculture difficult and potentially poisonous. Recent improvements in soil development, however, have eased the problem.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly13Title">Aurora Waves</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly13Description">Gleaming, multi-colored auroras last all day and night, moving eerily across the surface of the planet. Though their properties are greatly appreciated by residents and tourists, the electromagnetic residue is a headache for scientists.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly13ReducedTitle">Aurora Waves</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly13ReducedDescription">The gleaming, multi-colored auroras that once caused such headaches have been partially tamed by magnetic shielding. Fortunately, their beauty remains even though their negative effects have been reduced.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly14Title">Dense Atmosphere</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly14Description">Lava planets in particular, due to the continual combustion and high temperature of their crust, have atmospheres that are dense in organic compounds. Though it renders them a challenge to colonize, this anomaly also helps to increase the agricultural output.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly15Title">Psychoactive Air</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly15Description">With an atmosphere saturated by complex chemical compounds, life on this planet becomes interesting indeed if one does not breathe through a filter. Though the inevitable wandering thoughts make serious scientific research a bit difficult, it cannot be denied that everyone who lives here is really, really happy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly15ReducedTitle">Psychoactive Air</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly15ReducedDescription">With an atmosphere that was once saturated by complex chemical compounds, life on this planet was challenging. Application of terraforming technologies, however, has rendered the effects of the air less intense.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly16Title">Geothermic Activity</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly16Description">With lava rifts that pulse constantly and vast networks of minor volcanoes, two things are very clear about this planet: One: Industry can be powered cheaply and efficiently; Two: Inhabitants must watch where they step.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly16ReducedTitle">Geothermic Activity</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly16ReducedDescription">Applying enormous amounts of energy and grappling with gravitational alterations, the previously uncontrollable geothermic activity of the planet is now somewhat less intense.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly17Title">Seismic Activity</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly17Description">For those who like their rock and roll on a planetary level, this is the ideal home. Be warned, however, that though geo-physicists will adore it, it makes for nervous inhabitants and expensive construction.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly17ReducedTitle">Seismic Activity</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly17ReducedDescription">By manipulating the magnetic core, stabilizing continental drift, and improving construction techniques, the problems in daily life caused by seismic activity have been notably reduced.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly18Title">Long Season</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly18Description">With an unusually long orbital ellipse, the planet has very long seasons and thus is exposed to extremes of cold in winter and heat in summer. While this is fascinating for scientific experiment, it is difficult for agriculture and makes everyday life stressful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly18ReducedTitle">Long Season</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly18ReducedDescription">While the long orbital ellipse remains a fact of life, the application of terraforming sciences, advanced architecture, and improved agriculture has changed it from a health risk into a quaint tourist adventure.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly19Title">Meteor Strikes</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly19Description">While frequent and heavy meteor showers deliver precious metals for free, they also make life dangerous and require continual repairs to any exposed object. Radioactive and loaded with heavy isotopes, the meteors also wreak havoc with scientific research (and researchers).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly19ReducedTitle">Meteor Strikes</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly19ReducedDescription">For the first time in the history of the universe, the phrase "killer satellites" actually has a practical meaning. Thanks to cheap and robust sources of energy and heavily shielded orbitals, major meteor threats are neutralized high in the atmosphere.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly20Title">Polar Tempests</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly20Description">Exceedingly cold winters and large continental masses drive this planet through cycles of violent weather. This results in heavy wear and tear on infrastructure, and makes farming--and life in general--unpleasant.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly20ReducedTitle">Polar Tempests</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly20ReducedDescription">Controlled global warming, advanced thermo-efficient architecture, and really warm parkas have greatly lessened the negative effects of this anomaly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly21Title">Strong Magnetic Field</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly21Description">A large, liquid ferrous core gives this planet strong magnetic fields that fluctuate unpredictably. In order to counter this, much of the work done by industry and science has to undergo the expense of being carefully controlled and shielded.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly21ReducedTitle">Strong Magnetic Field</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly21ReducedDescription">Once directed non-baryonic magnetic flux technology was reduced to handheld size, the negative impacts of this anomaly were greatly reduced.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly22Title">Kessler Syndrome</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly22Description">An odd remnant of a past, lost civilization, the upper atmosphere of this planet is full of drifting debris. There is a cost to removing these remnants, and space-based experiments as well as satellites must be either expensively protected or often replaced.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly22ReducedTitle">Kessler Syndrome</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly22ReducedDescription">Though it took time, patience, and very large nets, much of the orbital debris that circulated the planet has been removed or dumped planetside for recycling.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly23Title">Acid Rain</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly23Description">Naturally occurring sulfur fumaroles cause highly acidic rain on this planet. This places heavy constraints on architecture and transport as well as creating a disagreeable atmosphere for the locals.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly23ReducedTitle">Acid Rain</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly23ReducedDescription">Partially by reducing the effects of the fumaroles and partially by hardening the infrastructure, many of the problems caused by this anomaly have been alleviated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly24Title">Irradiated</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly24Description">High levels of cosmic rays coupled with naturally occurring sources such as radon make this planet a dangerous place. There is a high risk of cancer-related diseases, and the radiation levels complicate scientific experimentation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly24ReducedTitle">Irradiated</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly24ReducedDescription">By developing and improving the ozone layer and atmosphere while better insulating construction, a large part of the dangerous effects of this radiation has been removed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly25Title">Single Moon</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly25Description">A single moon orbits this planet, affecting the weather and atmosphere. Occasionally, moons can be the site of ruins and remains of older civilizations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly25ReducedTitle">Single Moon</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly25ReducedDescription">The moon has been developed and explored. However, other than providing additional room for population to expand there is nothing unusual about it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly25ExploredTitle">Explored Moon</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly25ExploredDescription">The curiosities and anomalies of this moon have been explored and documented. Nothing remains to do but admire it, ideally at night.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly25AltTitle">Single Moon</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly25AltDescription">A single moon orbits this planet, affecting the weather and atmosphere. Occasionally, moons can be the site of ruins and remains of older civilizations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly26Title">Binary Moons</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly26Description">Irregularities in orbit and tidal forces can be explained by the existence of these two moons; it is a rare enough phenomenon that some will certainly want to come and either study them, or write sappy ballads in their honor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly26ReducedTitle">Binary Moons</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly26ReducedDescription">While scientifically interesting there are no unusual anomalies or phenomena associated with these moons, except for their powerful effect on poets and dreamers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly26ExploredTitle">Explored Moons</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly26ExploredDescription">Two moons orbit this planet, but they have already been investigated in search of secrets and riches. Their riches and anomalies already uncovered, now they only provide moonlight--and perhaps inspiration for poets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly26AltTitle">Binary Moons</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly26AltDescription">Irregularities in orbit and tidal forces can be explained by the existence of these two moons; it is a rare enough phenomenon that some will certainly want to come and either study them, or write sappy ballads in their honor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly27Title">Multiple Moons</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly27Description">There are many strange effects that multiple moons can have on orbit, tectonic, and tidal forces. Some sects may even worship them, while other peoples are content to watch them chase each other across the sky.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly27ReducedTitle">Multiple Moons</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly27ReducedDescription">While the formal scientific results of the investigation of these multiple moons was "nothing unusual", those who have watched the nighttime sky and the interplay of shadows beg to differ.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly27ExploredTitle">Explored Moons</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly27ExploredDescription">A number of moons orbit this planet, and they have generously ceded their secrets and riches. There is no need to do further investigation on the planetoids, but simply admire them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly27AltTitle">Multiple Moons</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly27AltDescription">There are many strange effects that multiple moons can have on orbit, tectonic, and tidal forces. Some sects may even worship them, while other peoples are content to watch them chase each other across the sky.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly28Title">Hostile Fauna</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly28Description">While the beasts of this planet were first described as "giant," "primal," and "impressive," a more accurate description would have been "clever, silent, and ravenous." Though they are eagerly hunted and in fact are a good food source, few people enjoy living on a planet where the food pyramid is in fact a circle.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly28ReducedTitle">Docile Fauna</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly28ReducedDescription">While the beasts of this planet were first described as "giant," "primal," and "impressive," these days the adjectives would tend to "controlled," "manageable," and "delicious."</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly29Title">Ancient Ruins</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly29Description">Search teams discover ruins of one of the many ancient civilizations that have risen and fallen since the birth of the universe. Trade, tourism, and research could potentially benefit from this rare find.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly30Title">Dust Lode</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly30Description">Once a base or battleground of the Endless civilization, their nanotechnological 'Dust' is omnipresent in the ground and atmosphere.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly31Title">Coral Reefs</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly31Description">Picturesque, rich, and fascinating, these lush reefs beautify the planet, provide sources of food, and are of interest to tourists (once they have been declared either non-lethal or only partially lethal).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly32Title">Cyber Flora</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly32Description">A hybrid species that grew from Dust-infected lichen, this nearly indestructible plant can be found thriving even in the harshest conditions. Its beautiful, glossy sheen and interesting bio-technical properties create both a stunning environment and a source of scientific knowledge.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly33Title">Strange Fossils</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly33Description">What strange beasts were these! Science Officers have discovered the remains of long-dead creatures that appear exceptional in every way -- size, variety, eating habits, and number of limbs. Anthropologists and cosmologists are eager to study these finds</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly34Title">Microfactories</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly34Description">Another innovation of the Endless, some Visited planets were sown with these Dust-built millimeter-scale factories that convert mineral solids into nutrient chains for crops. Adaptable or 'trainable' to a wide range of ecosystems, they are an enormous boon to food production and agricultural labor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly35Title">Mutated Flora</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly35Description">An example of biodiversity gone berserk, this planet shows a variety of plant mutations of every size, shape, color, scent, flavor, and psychoactive effect that one could imagine. Some of the more notable results include rich food supplies and ecstatic gourmet chefs.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly36Title">Low Gravity</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly36Description">A lower density of planetary core effects many things, of which gravity is the most notable. This has advantages for industrial production and makes kids really, really happy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly37Title">Deserted Cities</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly37Description">An eerie reminder of yet another lost civilization, deserted cities are scattered across the surface of this planet. Even stranger, many of the buildings and machines are still in working order. If a planet had been conceived to make scientists and engineers happy, it is this one.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly38Title">Molten Springs</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly38Description">Blessed--or cursed--by volcanic activity close to the surface and a metal-rich crust, geysers of molten metal spew their very dangerous and very valuable contents from numerous points on the planet. Industry and commerce can clearly benefit from this bizarre geology.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly39Title">Shattered Crust</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly39Description">The surface of this planet is a riot of cliffs, chasms, ridges, and spikes. While the broken surface means that many mineral resources can be easily mined, it also means that transport and construction will be challenging.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly39ReducedTitle">Tunneled Crust</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly39ReducedDescription">Though the surface of this planet remains rough, a few engineering projects involving viaducts and tunnels have rendered this problem unimportant. Fortunately, the landscape remains impressive.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly40Title">Komatiite Volcano</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly40Description">Dude, where's my silica? These volcanoes of ultramafic rock from deep within the planet's mantle are sources of useful metal alloys, and can be cheaply exploited for geothermal energy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly41Title">Propitious Seasons</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly41Description">This is not merely a planet that has the benefit of an axial tilt that produces seasonal variations in weather; the seasons and their associated climates lend themselves well to agriculture.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly42Title">Humeris Insidentes</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly42Description">This planet was inhabited by a highly advanced race that died off when a massive volcanic eruption induced a prolonged winter. The knowledge of their civilization was meticulously documented and stored in bunkers scattered across the planet. Clearly, they expected to rise up after the winter and continue their evolution. Sadly, the bunkers sit unlocked and unused, and the people have returned to the dust. Their knowledge, however, is yours to explore.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly43Title">Poor Soil</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly43Description">Though not lacking in dirt, the planet is surprisingly low in the nutrients and microbes that turn it into a rich compound that stimulates organic life. As a result, agricultural prospects are worse than usual.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly43ReducedTitle">Arable Soil</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly43ReducedDescription">The soil of this planet, once sterile and barren, is now much richer in the organic life necessary for agriculture.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly44Title">High Gravity</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly44Description">The unusually dense core of this planet gives it abnormally high gravity for its size. Architecture and industry must be adapted to deal with this. In addition, daily life is tiring and difficult.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly44ReducedTitle">Acceptable Gravity</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly44ReducedDescription">By the simple and straightforward process of bleeding excess gravitons across hyperdimensions into a parallel universe, the previously extreme gravity of the planet has been somewhat reduced.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly45Title">Behemoth Song</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly45Description">This strange planet emits natural sound and magnetic waves that imitate musical frequencies. The melodies can only be heard by ships in orbit with all electronics powered off, and their poignant beauty is said to be overwhelming.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly46Title">Talking World</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly46Description">There is a continual series of radio wave transmission from variable sites on the planet. Though they appear to be artificial and thus have some purpose, the transmitters have yet to be identified and the code or language remains an unsolved mystery.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly47Title">Fearful Symmetry</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly47Description">The planet's features exhibit a bilateral symmetry that is unnatural for its mathematical precision. One can only speculate as to what lies underneath the outer layers to cause this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomalyAcademyTitle">The Academy</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomalyAcademyDescription">A fabled place of political influence and Dust-enhanced power, the Academy plays a key role in the development of the galaxy. Under the watchful senses of its founder, highly trained Heroes graduate from this center of study, yet the ultimate purpose behind it all remains a mystery.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomalyEndlessWonder1Title">Husk of Knowledge</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomalyEndlessWonder1Description">Auriga housed the greatest site for the study of xenobiology ever created by the genius of the Endless. A towering achievement of industry and science, the surface and crust of the planet were a warren of laboratories, biospheres, and research centers. When the bombs fell during the Dust Wars, this enormous installation became the greatest expanse of ruins -- and store of lost knowledge -- in the known galaxy. Should the laboratories ever be repaired and the data recovered, the scientific benefit would be unimaginable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomalyEndlessWonder2Title">Spotora's Sanctum</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomalyEndlessWonder2Description">Also known as the Icarael's Watch, this is the one laboratory in all of the Endless-controlled galaxy that had the best claim to the discovery of the science of virtualization. Spotora Ortamm and her team are credited with the first consistent, replicable method for the virtualization of a sentient mind; the notes and equipment have enormous value in spite of their age.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetSizeTinyDescription">Often missed in casual system surveys due to their limited gravitational effects, these planets can nevertheless play important roles in a system.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetSizeSmallDescription">Capable of supporting a bigger population than their tiny-sized siblings, these worlds are common across the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetSizeMediumDescription">With a decent gravitational field, most races are very happy to populate medium-sized worlds.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetSizeLargeDescription">Substantial real-estate exists on these powerhouse planets, enabling large populations to be established.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetSizeHugeDescription">Few races enjoy the heavy gravity of huge-sized planets, but over time they can become vast engines of production as large populations can establish themselves.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeTerranTitle">Terran</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeTerranDescription">A crucible for the development of life in all its myriad forms, this planet is a world of roiling oceans, vast grasslands, teeming forests, and a restless climate. With hail and rain, sunshine and wind, most species find this world very accommodating.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeOceanTitle">Ocean</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeOceanDescription">Rich in life and in oxygen and atmosphere, an ocean planet teems with possibility. There are innumerable sources of food in the plants and animals of the oceanic biosphere, and tides and waves provide a ready source of energy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeJungleTitle">Jungle</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeJungleDescription">A sweltering, humid cauldron of a planet blanketed in thick rainforest alive with danger--and opportunity. Everything grows in excess, the planet a fecund source of food and predators, set against a backdrop of blazing-skied thunderstorms.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeTundraTitle">Tundra</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeTundraDescription">Somewhat dry and rather chilly, Tundra planets are nevertheless useful destinations for colonization. A wealth of scientific discovery, from thermodynamic studies to hardy plants and animals, waits the intrepid explorer, as do sources of wind and geothermal power for industry.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeAridTitle">Arid</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeAridDescription">What little water this planet holds is jealousy guarded in spine-covered gorse, hidden underground lakes, and rare storm clouds, but overcome the constant feeling of thirst, and you will find a planet rich in possibilities.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeArcticTitle">Arctic</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeArcticDescription">Icy-cold with hard-packed snows that last fell a million years past, this planet is a windswept, wintry graveyard. Those that hope to exploit this planet's natural wealth should steel themselves for hardship.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeDesertTitle">Desert</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeDesertDescription">Most life finds it a struggle to plant roots into the dry, shifting sands of the earth of this planet, but for the tenacious species who do, they will find a stark beauty to the world. With relatively little rainfall, erosion and decay are minimal, giving longevity to any civilization's constructions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeLavaTitle">Lava</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeLavaDescription">Though often unstable and not always pleasant to live on, the very substance of lava planets makes them a rich source of revenues and industry. Metals and unusual geologies are created in the heart of these roiling planets, and wealth and practical applications await those who harvest them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeLavaMultipleTitle">Lava</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeBarrenTitle">Barren</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeBarrenDescription">A harsh, unforgiving landscape of desolate plains and vast mountain ranges, the lack of water together with the freezing temperatures make this planet doubly difficult to exploit. But exploit it, species will. The world might lack atmosphere, literally, but as a place for research it is second to none.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeBarrenMultipleTitle">Barren</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeGasMethaneTitle">Gas Methane</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeGasMethaneDescription">While the center of these planets are little more than high-gravity fields of unstable methane ice, the atmosphere provides a kaleidoscope of beautiful, if volatile, images and resources.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeGasHeliumTitle">Gas Helium</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeGasHeliumDescription">Only marginally more hospitable than its hydrogen-gas sibling, this planet is a vast liquid ocean of hydrogen and helium shrouded in a thin and violent atmosphere. Not popular for vacations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeGasHydrogenTitle">Gas Hydrogen</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeGasHydrogenDescription">A cold, pitiless ball of hydrogen, mixed with a smattering of other trace gases and "ices", this planet is a challenge to settle for even the most technologically-advanced races.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeAsteroidsTitle">Asteroid Belt</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeSteppesTitle">Steppes</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeSteppesDescription">A world of rolling grasslands, this planet offers limited opportunities for farming on account of its poor soils and low rainfall. However, these worlds offer decent Dust yields, a result of a little understood biochemical process of the hardy grasses. Cud-chewers tend to make the most content settlers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeAshTitle">Ash</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeAshDescription">Millennia of volcanic activity have coated the surface with layer upon layer of fine ash, leading to vast lakes of soft charcoal--and rich mineral deposits. Industry-heads love these worlds. Their workers? Not so much. Fierce winds blow the ash skywards, creating surreal blizzards, and terrible living conditions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeSnowTitle">Snow</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeSnowDescription">Temperate enough for water to shuttle between its solid and liquid forms, a snow world is nonetheless pretty blinking cold. Crop yields are decent with the correct seedlines, but the biggest boon of these planets is their ability to inspire scientific thinking. Perhaps it's the snowflakes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeVeldtTitle">Savannah</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeVeldtDescription">One of the most life-friendly worlds around, Savannahs cradle many diverse ecosystems from verdant grasslands to hardy scrub to thin forests, and can support many uses. As regional breadbaskets, industrial bases, centers of science, and even Dust mining sites, Savannah planets encourage brisk population growth.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeBorealDescription">Typified by dense magnetic cores of molten iron, boreal planets allow scientists to explore a range of atmospheric, electromagnetic, and cosmic ray interactions in a chilly climate. Expect hardwoods and shaggy-haired mammals.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeForestTitle">Forest</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeForestDescription">Trees, glorious trees. Every scrap of earth colonized by the woody specimens, from rubber-producing sapwoods to iron-barked behemoths. Fuel, shelter, food, and an ecologist's wet dream—there are few worlds that can match these planets for broad appeal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeSwampTitle">Toxic</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeSwampDescription">Favored by monsters and hermits, toxic worlds offer fetid bogs, thick mists, and decent yields of methane gas. Less widely known, however, is their capacity for producing incredible crops of funky, yet still edible, fungi, due to the perfect conditions of moisture and mulch.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeMonsoonTitle">Monsoon</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeMonsoonDescription">No rain for most of the year, and then an absolute deluge for days upon days upon days. Wreaks havoc on transportation networks. Plants love it though, and apparently even higher-lifeforms do, given the inflated fertility rates. Guess there's not much else to do when it rains for days.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeIceTitle">Ice</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeIceDescription">Water, the miracle molecule, proves itself once again a god among its chemical brethren on ice worlds.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeAtollTitle">Atoll</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeAtollDescription">Coral chains stretching for thousands of kilometers in ringed and spiral formations create countless shallow lagoons where microcosms of evolution play out--and provide ample easy fishing. Sometimes it really is literally shooting fish in a barrel.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeGasFrozenTitle">Gas Frozen</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeGasFrozenDescription">Utterly inhospitable, these planets are so cold that even the air has frozen, rendering them without even the most scant of atmospheres to cover their nakedness. Staying alive, never mind, living, is a huge challenge, but the scientific insights more than make up for the hardship.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeGasColdTitle">Gas Cold</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeGasColdDescription">Positively mild compared to their frozen gas siblings, these worlds are nonetheless only a hundred or so degrees above absolute zero, and contain all manner of weird and wonderful chemistry from rivers of liquid nitrogen to lakes of methane. Nerd heaven.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeGasTemperateTitle">Gas Temperate</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTypeGasTemperateDescription">Occupying a Dust "goldilocks" zone, temperate gas worlds are an incredible source of the near-magical substance--if you've got the tech to survive on a surface that makes quicksand seem like a safe bet for walking on.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionForcedPeaceRelationReceiverSignedSophons">Seriously? Well, we'll see how long this idea lasts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionForcedPeaceRelationSenderSignedCravers">chrr--upp--zzz . . .
BLUNT: Necessity. Not kindness. Treasure your luck.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionForcedPeaceRelationReceiverSignedCravers">zzt--gkk!...
MOCKING: Strange. Alien. The Hive watches.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionForcedPeaceRelationSenderSignedHoratio">We hope that you will appreciate our glorious restraint, and that you are worthy of this peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionForcedPeaceRelationReceiverSignedHoratio">This peace is bold, I would say. Time will tell if it is also practical.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionForcedPeaceRelationSenderSignedTerrans">We hope that you appreciate the Empire's largesse. Perhaps you will even draw some benefit.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionForcedPeaceRelationReceiverSignedTerrans">You drive the Empire to peace? Let us see if it is worthwhile!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionForcedPeaceRelationSenderSignedTimeLords">This is necessary and logical. Make the most of your good fortune.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionForcedPeaceRelationReceiverSignedTimeLords">Peace can be arranged. But this side of the Rift nothing is sure.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionForcedPeaceRelationSenderSignedVampirilis">The Church once again demonstrates its peaceful benevolence. Pray profit from our generosity.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionForcedPeaceRelationReceiverSignedVampirilis">The Church wars only for good reason; we shall see if this peace is meaningful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionForcedPeaceRelationSenderSignedVenetians">This is probably the best deal you've seen in years. With peace comes profits, right?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionForcedPeaceRelationReceiverSignedVenetians">Peace is less fun without the upstream negotiations. We'll see how it goes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionForcedPeaceRelationSenderSignedUnfallen">We hope that you will accept our kindness, and that this peace brings fulfillment to both of us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionForcedPeaceRelationReceiverSignedUnfallen">We do not spurn peace, even when it is forced upon us. Let us see how it develops.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGreetingsSophons">Welcome to the Sophonity. There are some among us who doubt your intellectual chops. Please prove them wrong.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarSenderSignedSophonsWinning">Well, well, well. Not looking too good for you, is it? We've run the numbers and . . . we're definitely winning this war. But, don't worry. We Sophons aren't butchers. We're declaring this war over.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarReceiverSignedSophonsWinning">Smart move. We'll chalk this up as a Sophon victory, then move on to more friendly terms, okay? And you better not try any double-crossing tricks.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarSenderSignedSophonsLosing">So, erm, things aren't proceeding to plan. We're calling this one over. We lost, okay? Can we be friends now?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarReceiverSignedSophonsLosing">We Sophons appreciate your leniency. Maybe we could high-five to consolidate this truce?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceSenderSignedSophons">Don't take this the wrong way, but the Sophonity isn't feeling this "peace" state of affairs. Let's call it a "cold war" and see how things go, yeah?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceReceiverSignedSophons">Really? You want to go to "cold war"? Okay, chump, but don't come crying to us when things don't work out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceSenderSignedSophons">This alliance? Not working. Don't take it too hard. It's us not you, okay? And "cold war" doesn't mean "war", right?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceReceiverSignedSophons">Ah, you're killing me! Seriously? The old team? On the scrapheap? Alright, "cold war" it is.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceSenderSignedSophons">Look, don't take it personal. We Sophons are scientific types. Evidence-based reasoning and all that jazz. Logic dictates that we declare war on your empire. And who can argue with logic, right?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceReceiverSignedSophons">Sheesh! Out and out war? I guess our eggheads should've seen it coming; I mean, they probably did. So, expect defeat, yeah! Well, we'll see you on the battlefield, I guess.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarSenderSignedSophons">Well, this is awkward. To be honest, this didn't come up in the interview when I got this post, but a Sophon's gotta do their job. You understand, right? So, thing is, we're declaring war. On you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedSophons">You're making a big mistake declaring war on the Sophonity. Believe me, I've visited the top-secret development hangars. We're going to science the crap outta you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceSenderSignedSophons">I know it's probably a surprise for you, but it is what it is. We're tearing up the peace treaty. Prepare for war!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceReceiverSignedSophons">The Sophonity had hoped for a long and prosperous peace, but if it is war you want, then war you will have. Bring it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceSenderSignedSophons">Look, you've been milking this alliance for too long. We're freshening things up with a little bit of war. Think of it like a friend giving you a good slap.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceReceiverSignedSophons">Do you understand the meaning of the word "alliance"? Last time I looked it didn't mean attacking your ally. We're angry. For real. Get ready for a pasting from the Sophons.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandFromTruceReceiverSignedSophons">Ah, war, the instrument of barbaric races . . . we suspected this truce might not last. The Sophonity will be ready for you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarSenderProposedSophons">This cold war's gone far too long. We know you. You know us. How about we sign a peace treaty? Both our peoples are gonna love it. It's a win-win situation!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverSignedSophons">An offer of peace? Less time worrying about war, more time for learning? For sure. Where do we sign?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverRefusedSophons">Look, it sounds all fluffy mammals and rainbows, but it wouldn't be honest. Let's keep things on ice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarSenderProposedSophons">Isn't it time to thaw out this relationship? We could form an alliance and face the rest of the galaxy together? Our brains, your, ahem, looks, and we'll be unstoppable. Whaddya say?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverSignedSophons">Booyah! That's what I'm talking about. Allies. Has a good ring to it, don't ya think? The Sophons are on-board. 100%.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverRefusedSophons">Listen, the Sophonity would be crazy to ally up with you lot. Your recent history doesn't exactly inspire confidence. The answer's no.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceSenderProposedSophons">Peace is good, but we've been thinking . . . Isn't it time we hooked up, became allies? We've got some fat toys I'm sure you could borrow . . . How about it?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverSignedSophons">Personally, I've been pushing the triumvirate for this for a long time, so I'm super stoked that you've asked. We accept. Consider us allies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverRefusedSophons">No offence, but no. Why rock the boat? Let's keep things casual. Peace only, no strings attached.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSenderProposedSophons">The deal's a no brainer, right? Whaddya say?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverSignedSophons">The Sophonity can work with this. It's a deal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverRefusedSophons">You gotta be kidding me. No way. No deal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverIgnoredSophons">Look, that deal you put together wasn't exactly your finest hour. Let's just say no more about it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSignedSophons">This is the way it's going to be, you hear? The policy comes into effect as of . . . now.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledgedSophons">Well, I guess this is a thing then. Not that we have any say in the matter. Whatever.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentSignedSophons">The Sophonity just wanted to say . . . we like your style. Respect.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentAcknowledgedSophons">Ah, shucks. You’re making me forget the first hundred primes. Anyway, we appreciate you digging us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultSignedSophons">Call yourselves an intelligent civilization? I've seen smarter rocks.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultAcknowledgedSophons">Classy, real classy. Don't expect us Sophons to stoop to your level.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandSenderProposedSophons">Because we're smart and civilized and look kinda puny, some folks go round thinking the Sophons are a pushover. Well, we're not. So you better do as we ask!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandReceiverSignedSophons">And we Sophons thought civilized societies never made demands. Your immaturity has been noted.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandSenderSignedSophons">That demand you made? Not clever. It’s made the Sophonity rather angry--in an "angry enough to declare war" type of way. Prepare for a whipping.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandReceiverSignedSophons">You should've accepted our demands. War is only going to end badly--for you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementSenderProposedSophons">So, how about it? This trade deal is da bomb.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverSignedSophons">Yeah, let's trade. This deal is pretty sweet.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverRefusedSophons">Come on. Really? You think we were going to go for this? We have standards.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementSenderProposedSophons">You know you're getting a good deal when you make a science agreement with the Sophons. What do you say?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverSignedSophons">I think we can both agree that science is the winner here! Where do we sign?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverRefusedSophons">How do we put this . . . go take a hike with your science agreement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedSophonsPrepareWar">We were just getting ready for this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceWarToWarAcknowledgedSophons">So this is how you respect your treaties?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersReceiverSignedSophons">So, we'll miss visiting your neck of the galactic woods, but closed borders it is!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverSignedSophons">Yah! The Sophons are stoked to open our borders to you! We got some crazy stuff your peeps should definitely see.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverRefusedSophons">Er, how can I put this . . . we're not cool with opening our borders to you. You got previous, dawg.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersSenderSignedSophons">Sorry, pal. Your type isn't welcome in Sophon space. We're closing our borders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersSenderProposedSophons">Do you mind opening your borders? We Sophons make great visitors.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIgnoredSophons">Talk to the hand. We're busy calculating pi . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfReceiverSignedSophons">Wow, you kept yourselves quiet. How long you been watching us? Well, I hope we can get along.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfSenderSignedSophons">Hey, we're the Sophons. Your friendly galactic science buddies. Don't mess with us!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverSignedSophons">Wow, you've really travelled, huh? We'd be happy to see those starcharts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverSignedSophons">Holy smoke, yes! The Sophonity is down with big data! Bring it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingReceiverSignedSophons">You're bouncing? On us? Our number geeks think you're making a bad call. Well, whatever.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementReceiverSignedSophons">Our trade agreement not working out for you? We’re gonna miss you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementReceiverSignedSophons">You're canceling a science agreement with us, the Sophons? What are you smoking?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverSignedSophons">A truce? About time! Where do we sign?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationSenderProposedSophons">Don't think this in any way invalidates our ability to kick your butts, but . . . how about a truce?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverRefusedSophons">Er, let's see. No. No truce. We're quite happy with the way this war is panning out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverRefusedSophons">Don't take this the wrong way, but we're happy with our own star charts. Keep your maps.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverRefusedSophons">The thing is . . . can we really trust your vision reports? So the answer's no. We're good.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralPotentialTradingPartnerSophons">Well, talking science is only going to confuse you, but maybe we can be trade partners? You know how to make stuff, right?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralPotentialFriendSophons">Wassup?! You and us are going to takeover the galaxy one proton at a time! We got the feels.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFirstImpressionSophons">Respect. We appreciate the gesture.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementSameAlignementSophons">You getting the same vibes off those guys as us? Great minds, eh?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGreatDeedsSophons">Way to go, dude. We are 100% aligned with you on those guys. Until, you know, we're not.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAskTributeSophons">Look at this way: we'll spend your Dust much better than you ever could. I mean, just look at the threads you buy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouHurtMeSophons">Wow, the Sophon psyche hasn't been so wounded since we came second in The Galaxy's Brainiest Species contest a couple of decades back. You got claws, dude.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouWereCruelToMeSophons">Now, some races go in for this punishment shtick, but not us. You're in our bad books.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationGetOutAfterTrespassSophons">You seen the latest episode of that new reality show, Home Invader? Lumeris girl breaks into a Vodyani temple. Vodyani finds her, threatens to harvest her essence if she doesn't get out. That's kinda where we are.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterTrespassingSophons">Perhaps it's not clear in your pea brains, so we'll break it down real simple. Get your rustbucket ships out of our space.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterColonizationSophons">Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You're settling in that system? Next to the mighty, intellectually unparalleled Sophonity? Bad karma, man. Do it again? Seriously bad stuff will go down.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionSophons">Didn't you get the memo? Sheesh, those Sophons in Administration really are the pits. Look we had designs on that system. Expect some competition.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoColonizationProblemSophons">Welcome to the 'hood! If there's anything we can do to help you settle in just holla.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassMilitarySophons">What da Dust, dude? Didn't we make it clear as matrix algebra? Your military is on our turf! You're on the blacklist!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationRevengeSophons">Well, that was low. We'll be getting back to you soon. For reals.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarOpportunistSophons">Like, don't take it personal, but you're looking like easy pickings right now. We'll, err, make it as painless as we can, okay.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementProposePeaceSophons">Come on, you're a stand-up empire, we're cool--we should sign a peace deal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDeceiverSophons">Wow, you played us like a cheap supercomputer. We'll . . . we'll . . . get our own back on you. Err, yeah. That.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockingExpansionSophons">Your empire stands in the way of the mighty warriors of the Sophonity's expansion . . . Well, maybe not "mighty warriors" but science geeks. Anyway, you're in our way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSneakyDemandSophons">Well, strap us on a rocket and fire us at the moon! You make demands?! We're unfriending you!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralOpenBordersAcceptedSophons">Thanks! We're coming over to take a look around, make ourselves at home. And if we see any big red buttons while we're here? We'll be sure to press, I mean, not press them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementTributeReceivedSophons">These funds will totally be put towards securing your future. Not for big parties, blinged up starships, or Lumeris-tailored suits. No, siree.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForExpansionSophons">We thought we'd set clear boundaries, dude. Personal space isn't to be encroached lightly. That's right! It's time for war. And we're bringing our nasty science!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersForProtectionSophons">Some Sophons are getting nervous about all your grandstanding. "Check out the size of my fleets", "Feel my manpower", "Count my command points". Not cool. Please don't visit.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoAttacksSufferedSophons">You're pretty chill, huh? No fighting, no drama. We're down with that. Keep it up.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDemandAcceptedSophons">See, our demand was pretty reasonable, eh? I mean, maybe it shouldn't even have been called a demand. More like a friendly piece of advice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPositiveContractSophons">Including a few sweeteners, huh? Nice. Keep things good with us, and you'll go a long way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoHostileActionsSophons">You're behaving a little too nicely . . . hmm, suspicious . . . or maybe you really are one of the good guys? Guess we'll find out, huh? But, like, good job.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementUltimatumFulfilledSophons">Whaddya know? We say jump and you say how high. You're learning!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAttackedUnitsSophons">Hello, is there anybody home? What's not computing? Respect our borders doesn't mean attack us. Expect payback.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumDisregardedSophons">Not heeding our words, huh? You really don't know who you're messing with, do you? We got science on our side!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightSophons">Dawg, it might seem like a small thing, like focusing on a red dwarf in a galaxy of supergiants, but we can't overlook your second new digs in our hood. We got a reputation to uphold. We're pressing for war!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassingSophons">Please, colonize all you want, trample through our systems. Not. Next you'll be taking over our settlements.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationColonizationSophons">Really? Of all the worlds in all the systems across the galaxy, you decide to settle on one right under our noses? That's trash.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersSophons">Yo, fam, we're doing a spot of spring cleaning. No witnesses like. That's right, we're closing borders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightNoClosedBordersSophons">Well, your military ships were straight-up lit--sleek curves, savage colors, sexy mods--but the close-up view wasn't welcome. Stop coming over!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAttackedUnitsSophons">So, you thought you'd pick on the small scrawny alien with the bulbous head? Go you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoBribeParagonSophons">What kind of low down, dirty, corrupt species do you think we are? I think you have us mistaken for the Lumeris. Shove your bribe.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarLongPeaceBetrayedSophons">What happened to our extended spell of peace? You are one cold customer--who's about to get considerably hotter.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutScienceAgreementSophons">So, we've got some slick science to bring to the table. Question is: do you?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutTradeAgreementSophons">The number geeks tell us that a trade agreement with you could be a lucrative venture, so we're mulling it over.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralMercantileThinkingAboutTradeAgreementSophons">Just to let you know--we're selling the Sophonity the idea of a trade agreement with you guys hard right now. Expect a proposal soon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulPeaceAcknowledgementSophons">You know, with this long spell of peace between our Empires, we're coming to think of you as family. Not close family, naturally. More like a weird third cousin.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulTradeAgreementAcknowledgementSophons">Let's fistbump in praise of our trade agreement! Some of those goods you've been sending over--mind-blowing!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulScienceAgreementAcknowledgementSophons">Who'd have thought it? Us, the galaxy's foremost scientists, getting something out of a science agreement with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandSophons">I'm telling you, the Sophonity are going to have to revisit this whole friendship thing if you keep making demands.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilySophons">Nice battle fleets. Right in our galactic backyard, so we get to admire their firepower up close and personal. They are on their way elsewhere though, right?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedSovereignSpaceSophons">Kudos. We asked you not trespass or make demands and you came through!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationIsolationistPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumSophons">You had one job! Don't trespass with military vessels. You blew it. We're canvassing for Cold War relations ASAP.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyUltimatumSophons">Do you need us to draw you a picture?! Get your battle fleets out of our territory stat!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandAndNoGestureSophons">Your negotiation skills leave a lot to be desired. When you ask for something, maybe you should offer something in return.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumSophons">Look, we asked you not to flaunt your fleets with all their fancy guns in our space, and what do you do? We're campaigning for Cold War relations!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedNoTrespassSophons">Thanks for moving along those military vessels. It's not like we didn't trust you, just they were spoiling the view . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeNoGestureSophons">Sheesh! We hope you do dating better than you do diplomatic relations. We were waiting for a gift. Expect the cold shoulder!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerMadeGestureSophons">Better late than never, we guess . . . keep this up and you'll be back in our good books in no time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingSenderSignedSophons">Hey, what do you think? Two sets of eyes see twice as much, so how about we share vision?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingSenderSignedSophons">You know that whole sharing vision thing was nice, but now it's over. Sorry.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingSenderProposedSophons">Ever curious just how much of the galaxy we've seen? Sign here, and we'll show you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedHelpSophons">You might've seen--our war with those other clods isn't going too well. Bad space weather...ahem. Anyway, how would you feel about an alliance?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedCounterOtherAllianceSophons">Looks like some folks are getting together to gang up on any loners . . . I know we're not tight, but if we were to suggest being allies . . . ?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedHelpSophons">We've had some good times, right? Well, how about coming to our aid in our time of need? Yeah, we're taking a kicking, but an alliance with you could turn things round!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedCounterOtherAllianceSophons">Don't you look with envy--and worry--at that alliance forming across the galaxy? With a little diplomatic effort, that could be us. Watch this space!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceAgainstCommonEnemySophons">Woah, you're not fond of those idiots either, are you? What do you say we get together and give them a good slap? Expect an alliance proposal soon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForGoodRelationsSophons">Isn't it time we took this peace to the next stage? With our science, and your, erm--what are your strengths again?--we could make a stellar alliance. We'll put a proposal together.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForVictorySophons">Great minds, eh? Both our empires are tracing a similar path to infinity--and victory! What we could do is form an alliance, and share the adulation. We'll get the diplo bods on it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNeedMilitaryHelpSophons">Erm, we thought we had this war covered, but things have headed south. Fast. So, as our favorite allies, how about you send some back up? We'll totally big you up afterwards.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralHelpingAllySophons">Looks like you're in a spot of bother. Have no fear! The Sophonity looks out for its allies--we're sending in the big guns!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGiftSophons">Here, a small gift for our fave allies. No, no, you don't need to make it a big deal. Really, no. Well, okay, if you must.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGoodGiftSophons">That's right, you're getting something from the Sophonity top-drawer. Only the best for our Number One Super Awesome Geekin' Empire!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandNoGiftReceivedSophons">And the Sophonity thought you and us were tight! What happened to you guys? Straight-up demands? We're bailing on this alliance when we can.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandSophons">Something wrong with your linguistic function? A demand? All you need to do is ask! We're allies, after all.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementVeryPositiveGiftSophons">That's a sweet gift! Appreciated. It needed to be though. Let's let bygones be bygones, eh? To the Alliance! No? Not into the chest-thumping stuff? No worries.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralWeakGiftSophons">What do you call that?! The cat's dragged in more appealing gifts! Flaccid! No, that won't do at all. We're pouting.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoHelpThenNoGiftReceivedSophons">We think you need to go to 'How To Be A Good Ally' class. After recent events you got a long way to go. But we're hopeful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementReceivedHelpLateSophons">So, ally, you finally came through! You'd be late to your own funeral, right? But thanks anyway.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoHelpReceivedSophons">Did the message not get through? We're in deep doo-doo, and need the help of our allies. Hint: that's you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemNoGiftSophons">So, your culture is all the rage, and one of our systems switched to your side. A bitter pill that you could've sweetened. We're looking for exit strategies from this alliance!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemMultipleSophons">Ally? Maybe it's worse that you stole one of systems peacefully! I mean, that's sneaky! We're getting out of this alliance post-haste.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAwokeGuardianSophons">Wow, this Guardian you woke-up is fascinating. We Sophons are having a field day studying it!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRootedMySystemSophons">These tendrils you planted in Sophon space are sweet! Faster travel? Yes, please! Feel free to plant more.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarAmAlreadyAtWarSophons">Can't you see we're busy dealing with another front? War with you at this time just isn't convenient. We'll deal with you later.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarNoRoomToExpandSophons">Look, don't take it personal. It's just getting a little crowded in Sophon space, and you're sitting on some swell territory. We'll try and make it quick.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPlayerAlreadyAtWarSophons">Hey, don't mind us declaring war on you while you're fighting elsewhere . . . erm, look over there!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralBlockadedSystemAtWarSophons">Sophons are suffering on the system you blockaded! Please reconsider your decision.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAttackedCiviliansAtWarSophons">Barbaric! Innocent civilians died in your attack on unarmed ships! Monster!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAwokeGuardianAtWarSophons">Did we give you the right to awaken freaky behemoths on our planets? No! It is kinda interesting though. Wow..</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDestroyedMyPlanetAtWarSophons">You destroyed a world? A whole world? Millions of citizens and all their hopes and dreams snuffed out in an instant. We are lost for words.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleAtPeaceSophons">This messing with time stuff is pretty swell. The Sophonity should bone up on the math, figure it out ourselves. Thanks!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleAtPeaceSophons">Erm, far be it from us to question the motives of extra-dimensional beings who can alter the flow of time, but . . . what the rift, dude? We liked that system the way it was!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemUltimatumSophons">Cultural assimilation of one of our systems is not cool. Even if your culture is pretty phat. Please don't do it again.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDisregardedConversionUltimatumSophons">There you go again, spreading your fine culture and taking over another of our systems. Well, we asked you not to, but you did it again so we're petitioning to end this peace ASAP.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRespectedConversionUltimatumSophons">There you go! You can listen to a bit of friendly advice and cut out the cultural assimilation antics. Go you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleSophons">You honor us with this beneficial singularity. Gotta say the whole Triumvirate was caught cold though--we did not expect this. Thanks!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleSophons">I'm not sure we've legislated for this type of time-altering stuff, but if we had you'd be on trial, buddy. In any case we're nettled. We'll be watching you closely.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockadedMySystemSophons">Ah, you're one of those jerks who blocks folks in the street thinking it's funny. End the blockade. Pronto.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedMyPlanetSophons">A completely unprovoked and incomprehensibly excessive attack! You will be tried for crimes against the galaxy!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementOutpostCompetitionWonSophons">Sophon science--nobody's gonna beat it. That outpost was in the bag the moment we entered the race. We did warn you . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionLostSophons">Ah, trash! We lost? How'd you complete that outpost so fast? We guess someone in the Sophonity messed up their sums. Heads are gonna roll--not literally, that'd be gruesome.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoTributeReceivedSophons">What would the Lumeris say? "Slow business? Screw you, pay me." And what would they do when somebody didn't. Hmm . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredOfBorderUnitsSophons">That's, erm, an impressive fleet you've got there. Purely for training purposes, right? (Shush, Leumac, I got this covered!)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredAfterAttacksSophons">We'll do anything you ask! Well, maybe not anything . . . but, please, just don't hurt us anymore.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationClosedBordersScaredSophons">You're, erm, scaring us. We do get scared easily, granted, but we think it's justified in this case. Don't be offended.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingHarassWarSophons">Let's wrestle!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingConquestWarSophons">We have been constrained for too long and need to expand. You're merely in the way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedAPlanetSophons">What in the name of science was that?! Destroying planets--even non-Sophon ones--is a crime against nature!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAfraidDestroyedAPlanetSophons">Wow, destroying planets now, eh? We're not on your blacklist are we? Are we?!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPeaceDestroyedAPlanetSophons">What kind of allies have we made peace with? Destroying worlds is beyind the pale, dude!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAbusedDiplomaticDemandsSophons">What gives?! We accepted your demands, yet you still declare war. The gloves are coming off!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarCordialIdleSophons">Some of our deepest thinkers are wondering if an imposed peace is a friendly action, but we guess it's a good thing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarAfraidSophons">Peace is good. We're all friends here, right? No tricks.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarHostileWarySophons">Haha, peace, good one! Oh, you're serious? Well, we gotta admit to being a little surprised given your past behavior.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPeaceUnwillingToUnsureSophons">Well, color us surprised. This peace is working out okay.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceSophons">This peace is dead in the water! Why did you impose it in the first place?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRequiredShowOfGoodFaithSophons">The Triumvirate thinks you should back up these overtures of peace with a more . . . tangible offering. Like a stack of Dust. Dig?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFaithReceivedSophons">That gift you sent? We appreciate it. We're doing swell things with it, let me tell you. Peace is good, huh?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoshowOfGoodFaithReceivedSophons">So, no gift, huh? Well, this peace isn't doing much for us. We'll be bailing shortly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceWarIntentionSophons">Yep, we left that peaceful alliance you forced upon us. Next up, war!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNegotiationRefusedSophons">Gifts treaties, trinkets, complaints, whatever. We're tired of you and your diplomacy!</LocalizationPair>

ANGRY: We told you what you should not do--and you disregarded our words. Foolish.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightCravers">tsk--mkk--tzz . . .

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassingCravers">kkktt--gdo--pftt . . .
OFFENDED: The Hive already considered your nearby colonization an affront. Your subsequent trespass into Craver space is an outrage.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationColonizationCravers">jgrtt--mckkttt--zzzzz . . .
BLUNT: First trespass, and now a land grab. No matter, it makes it easier for us to consume you.</LocalizationPair>

FIRMLY: The Hive turns inwards. Craver space is off-limits. Our borders are closed.</LocalizationPair>

EXULTANT: We are going to destroy you. Painfully.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoBribeParagonCravers">ftt--dzss--plish . . .

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarLongPeaceBetrayedCravers">kkktt--gdo--pftt . . .
FLAT: Peace never suited the Hive anyway. We welcome war.</LocalizationPair>

BRIEF: The Hive is always seeking to become a more efficient killing machine. Perhaps we might exchange knowledge.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutTradeAgreementCravers">chrr--upp--zzz . . .
NEUTRAL: The Queen instructs the Hive to examine trading relations. After all, trade is the engine of conflict.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralMercantileThinkingAboutTradeAgreementCravers">bzzz--chrrrr--ktsz . . .
NEUTRAL: Cravers naturally resist any interactions other than waging war, but trade may be beneficial for us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulPeaceAcknowledgementCravers">tchok--fzzz--zzzink . . .
NEUTRAL: This period of peace has made the Hive think of you not as future nourishment, but occasional snacks.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulTradeAgreementAcknowledgementCravers">chttt--bzzz--pfft . . .
SATISFIED: Many Cravers were skeptical about trade, but it has allowed us to widen our appetites.</LocalizationPair>

SATISFIED: Your science makes us faster, stronger, deadlier. We welcome it.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedSovereignSpaceCravers">tchok--fzzz--zzzink . . .
CONDESCENDING: The Hive wonders if your race has spines. Would you obey any command? Nevermind, we like it this way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationIsolationistPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumCravers">kkktt--gdo--pftt . . .

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyUltimatumCravers">jgrtt--mckkttt--zzzzz . . .
ANGRY: Remove your battle fleets from Craver space. Now.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandAndNoGestureCravers">ftt--dzss--plish . . .
RUDE: What's so hard? Even the Hive understands diplomacy. You take something, you give something. It's not take. It's give and take.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumCravers">azzz--ckttt--flrrr . . .
BLUNT: By Craver standards I asked nice. Now I'm asking nasty. Next time your battle fleets enter Hive space, blood--or whatever fluid courses your pitiful bodies--will be drained, then boiled, then congealed, and then eaten. One crew member at a time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedNoTrespassCravers">bzzz--chrrrr--ktsz . . .

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedCounterOtherAllianceCravers">tchok--fzzz--zzzink . . .
NEUTRAL: You know, Cravers can make alliances. We should become allies to counter other hostile alliances. We will make a proposal.</LocalizationPair>

BRIEF: We wage war against terrible foes who slaughter us. Abide by our pact, and come to the aid of your ally. Quickly.</LocalizationPair>

SWIFTLY: War always draws the Hive. We will come to your aid, ally.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGoodGiftCravers">chttt--bzzz--pfft . . .
NEUTRAL: Know how much the Hive sacrifices in bringing you this gift, ally.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandNoGiftReceivedCravers">dzzz--tsk--tsk . . .
OFFENDED: The Hive doesn't respond to demands made without incentives. Our alliance will soon be dead.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandCravers">tsk--mkk--tzz . . .
COLDLY: Demands should not be made to allies. The Hive sees you for what you are.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementVeryPositiveGiftCravers">chrr--upp--zzz . . .
NEUTRAL: The gift is well received. And necessary. Do not err again.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralWeakGiftCravers">tchok--fzzz--zzzink . . .
OFFENDED: This 'gift' is more insult than redress. Inadequate!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoHelpThenNoGiftReceivedCravers">kkktt--gdo--pftt . . .
BLUNT: Are you teaching the Hive a lesson? That we're on our own. That we'll always be on our own. Allies or not. That is the charitable explanation for your inaction. Improve!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementReceivedHelpLateCravers">jgrtt--mckkttt--zzzzz . . .
RUDE: At long last. The Hive thought you'd abandoned your ally. We don't know whether to be grateful or angry.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoHelpReceivedCravers">ftt--dzss--plish . . .
FIRMLY: Where is the help? Send aid or we will come for you--if the Hive survives this onslaught.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemNoGiftCravers">azzz--ckttt--flrrr . . .
BLUNT: Why our system would want to convert to your culture is baffling, but that is the reality. Without redress, though, the Hive must move to end this alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemMultipleCravers">bzzz--chrrrr--ktsz . . .DISGUSTED: Call yourself an ally? Influence conversion is the way of cowards! The Hive moves to end this alliance.</LocalizationPair>

DISMISSIVE: The creature is impressive, but how well can it fight?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRootedMySystemCravers">chttt--bzzz--pfft . . .
QUIETLY: In their blend of the organic and inorganic, Cravers find these tendrils familiar, comforting. And the speed boost is a boon. The Hive gives grudging thanks.</LocalizationPair>

NEUTRAL: The Hive lives for war, never fears its coming. But we fight another front. We will meet you in battle soon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarNoRoomToExpandCravers">tsk--mkk--tzz . . .
NEUTRAL: This should be no surprise. We are Cravers. We crave waging war and conquering worlds.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPlayerAlreadyAtWarCravers">chrr--upp--zzz . . .
BLUNT: The Hive seeks an easy war. Hence our attack on you, while you're engaged elsewhere. Even Cravers sometimes fight dirty.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralBlockadedSystemAtWarCravers">tchok--fzzz--zzzink . . .
MOCKING: So you blockade a Craver system. How pathetic.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAttackedCiviliansAtWarCravers">kkktt--gdo--pftt . . .
DISGUSTED: All Cravers are ready to fight, but your attack on civilian vessels carrying Hive workers is a craven act. Weakling!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAwokeGuardianAtWarCravers">jgrtt--mckkttt--zzzzz . . .
DETERMINED: What is this monstrous creature you have summoned in our midst? The Hive will protect itself.</LocalizationPair>

DETERMINED: The Hive will recover from this murderous act. Planetcide is an abomination only fit for Cravers.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemUltimatumCravers">tchok--fzzz--zzzink . . .
BLUNT: Perhaps the Hive was mistaken in forging a peace with your empire. Convert another of our systems at your peril.</LocalizationPair>

ANGRY: You failed to listen! This peace was a mistake and will be ended.</LocalizationPair>

NEUTRAL: Good. You listen. The Hive's systems are the Hive's alone.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleCravers">tsk--mkk--tzz . . .
BRIEF: A useful singularity. A strange way to wage cold war. What game do you play?</LocalizationPair>

BLUNT: This singularity is an affront to the Hive. Be ready for retaliation.</LocalizationPair>

NEUTRAL: Your blockade is pointless. And unwelcome.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedMyPlanetCravers">kkktt--gdo--pftt . . .

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementOutpostCompetitionWonCravers">jgrtt--mckkttt--zzzzz . . .
RIDICULING: The Hive mocks your feeble efforts. The system is ours.</LocalizationPair>

NEUTRAL: You assemble a mighty fleet. No matter. The Hive relishes a fight, no matter the odds.</LocalizationPair>

BLUNT: Your attacks leave the Hive staring into the abyss. But we do not blink.</LocalizationPair>

BLUNT: The Hive closes its borders. We have our reasons.</LocalizationPair>

QUIET: Be warned: use such destructive power against the Hive, and we will come for you.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarSenderSignedVampirilisLosing">In our Virtual Gods' infinite wisdom, we call a cease-fire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarReceiverSignedVampirilisLosing">Our Virtual Gods grant us salvation! We rejoice in this truce!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceSenderSignedVampirilis">We doubt your true intentions in this so-called time of peace. Let us better reflect our true relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceReceiverSignedVampirilis">Whether at peace or not, our Faith guides us. But, be under no illusions, you will be judged for this betrayal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceSenderSignedVampirilis">To maintain this alliance would be an apostasy of the highest order. Therefore we renounce our union.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceReceiverSignedVampirilis">The Holy Church is most disappointed. But, we know that the path of the righteous is often beset by the inequities of the profane. This choice will bring you no glory, only shame.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceSenderSignedVampirilis">Our Virtual Gods mark you as Heretics dressed in Saints' clothing. And so we smite thee.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceReceiverSignedVampirilis">This is no revelation for the Holy Church. Always be wary of the sinner, for his repentance is often made in falsehood. We will enjoy crushing the unbelievers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarSenderSignedVampirilis">The Holy Church will not tolerate your idolatry of false Gods any longer! You must be excised.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedVampirilis">A foolish choice. The Holy Church trusts your people have made peace with their pagan Gods. For they will die in their millions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceSenderSignedVampirilis">You should feel blessed. The peace between our empires has been a great instrument of our evolution. Now though, this peace has outlived its value.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceReceiverSignedVampirilis">We are hardened to such betrayals. When our Holy Armies lay siege to your worlds, and your masses burn and scream for mercy, do not think we will suffer a drop of guilt. That will be yours to possess alone.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceSenderSignedVampirilis">This alliance has been deemed heretical by the Holy Church. War is our penance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceReceiverSignedVampirilis">By all that is Holy, you will pay for this treachery a thousand-fold.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandFromTruceReceiverSignedVampirilis">Deceivers walk among us. That is known. The leeching of your Essence will be that much sweeter for your lies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarSenderProposedVampirilis">The Holy Church feels it is time for a more trusting union between our empires. Will you swear to peace?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverSignedVampirilis">We welcome a more harmonious era. Glory to the Virtuals!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverRefusedVampirilis">Would a bird of prey trust a snake in its nest? No. Likewise, we would not trust you within our Holy realm. There will be no peace treaty between us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarSenderProposedVampirilis">An alliance between our empires would be a most sacred bond, and would usher in a glorious new era. Have faith, make this pact, and revel in the adulation. So, what is your answer?</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverRefusedVampirilis">Only the blind would not see this proposal for the poison that it is. There shall be no alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceSenderProposedVampirilis">The Holy Church deems your conduct most Hallowed. An alliance between our empires would be a suitable means of acknowledging this truth. Do you concur?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverSignedVampirilis">Mark this day as a triumph for all those who fight apostasy. We accept your offer of an alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverRefusedVampirilis">The peace between our empires is barely tolerated by some splinters of our society. To enter into an alliance would be a blasphemy too far. We refuse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSenderProposedVampirilis">To accept this offer would be to bask in the eternal glory of the Virtuals. You must choose . . . what do you say?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverSignedVampirilis">We sign this deal in our desire to see the tyrannical crushed, wherever they may spring.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverRefusedVampirilis">This offering has the mark of the infidel. We refuse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverIgnoredVampirilis">The Church never dirties its hands with such grubby deals. Refrain from mentioning it again.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSignedVampirilis">The stars foretold this long ago. Live with it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledgedVampirilis">You light the fire, and we live with the flames. So be it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentSignedVampirilis">Blessings from the Holy Church of the Virtual. You minister well.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentAcknowledgedVampirilis">I thank you, but remind you I am but an instrument of the Virtual.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultSignedVampirilis">Only a fool spares breath on the foolish.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultAcknowledgedVampirilis">Bring more than words the next time you insult the Holy Church of the Virtual.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandSenderProposedVampirilis">If you value the skins, the hearts, the very souls of your people, then you will make the Holy choice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandReceiverSignedVampirilis">The Holy Church only suffers demands from the Virtuals. You have made a grave mistake.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandSenderSignedVampirilis">You have badly misjudged the situation if you believed we would accede to your demands. Instead, the Holy Church will repay this insult with a righteous vengeance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandReceiverSignedVampirilis">It is no matter. Your refusal of our demands reveals your empire as an unholy carbuncle that needs excision.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedVampirilisPrepareWar">Like the serpent, your duplicitous ways have long been known to the Holy Church. We are ready for you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceWarToWarAcknowledgedVampirilis">Let us brand you with the mark of the betrayer, so all know the falsity of your words. Then, by the light of the Virtuals, let us inflict agonies upon you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementSenderProposedVampirilis">If you want to remain respected in the Church's eyes then you will accept this trade agreement. So, I have your acceptance, yes?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverSignedVampirilis">The Church of the Virtual accepts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverRefusedVampirilis">The Church will try to raze this abominable proposal from its collective mind. Our answer is no.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementSenderProposedVampirilis">Sometimes science and religion make a beautiful union. Do you accept our proposal?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverSignedVampirilis">May science--under the watchful eye of the Divine--flourish in both our empires. We accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverRefusedVampirilis">Like poisoned Essence, this proposal is anathema to the Church. We refuse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersReceiverSignedVampirilis">The Church notes the closure of your borders to the Vodyani.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverSignedVampirilis">The Church brings only Light to the Darkness. The Vodyani opens its borders and looks forward to the day your people bathe in our Light.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverRefusedVampirilis">We refuse to open our borders to such heathens. Cleanse your souls, and perhaps we can change this decision.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersSenderSignedVampirilis">The Church's affairs are not for your eyes. We will close our borders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersSenderProposedVampirilis">The Church of the Virtual wishes to spread its message of enlightenment on your worlds. Will you open your borders to us?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIgnoredVampirilis">The Church has no time for this matter.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfReceiverSignedVampirilis">The Church wonders how long you have been watching from the shadows, but we are happy to see you in the light.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfSenderSignedVampirilis">We meet you in the name of the Church of Virtual Saints. Let ours be a blessed union.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverSignedVampirilis">The Church is always seeking fresh converts. We are happy to learn more about the shape of the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverSignedVampirilis">The Church of the Virtual Endless welcomes this knowledge, and reciprocates in kind. May you treat this wisdom with reverence.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingReceiverSignedVampirilis">You break your pact with the Holy Church? Be prepared for consequences.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementReceiverSignedVampirilis">You have disappointed the Church. We hope this isn't the beginning of further disloyalties.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementReceiverSignedVampirilis">The Church's sciences rival even that of the Sophonity. Why have you turned your back on this agreement?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverSignedVampirilis">You recognize the superiority of the Church. Good. Then we can agree to a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationSenderProposedVampirilis">The Church feels this war is neither a matter of dogma nor advantage. We offer a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverRefusedVampirilis">No, we don't think so. The Church is just getting started with your religious education. There will be no truce.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralPotentialFriendVampirilis">It is good to see potential friends--and converts--in this vast galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFirstImpressionVampirilis">The Church appreciates your good efforts, and looks forward to good relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementSameAlignementVampirilis">Please note that the Church shares your opinion of certain other species in this galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGreatDeedsVampirilis">Your great efforts to maintain the equilibrium have not gone unnoticed by the Church.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAskTributeVampirilis">To support the faithful is a great though expensive task for the Church. It seems only right that you help donate.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouHurtMeVampirilis">You have injured that which is holy, and the Church takes offense.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouWereCruelToMeVampirilis">Your acts of barbaric cruelty have inflamed the righteous anger of the faithful!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationGetOutAfterTrespassVampirilis">You trespass upon sacred space, and the Church of Virtual Saints insists that you leave.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterTrespassingVampirilis">If you do not leave our sacred space on your own, the Protectors of the Faithful will eject you. Forcefully.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterColonizationVampirilis">Though your desire to live in proximity to the Church is commendable, we cannot accept a colony of infidels so close to us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionVampirilis">Your selection of systems for colonization is understandable. Do not be surprised if the Church makes the same choice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoColonizationProblemVampirilis">While the Church welcomes converts, unbelievers like you who invade neutral territories are less welcome.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassMilitaryVampirilis">You seem to feel it is not a problem to send military fleets into the sacred space of the Church. But the Church does not agree.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationRevengeVampirilis">Perfidy and treachery are sins that live long in the memory of the holy Church.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarOpportunistVampirilis">Your refusal to build defensive capacity shows that you care little for your territory. The Church would be pleased to take it from you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementProposePeaceVampirilis">The Church seeks more time for prayers and less for battle. We would propose peace between our nations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDeceiverVampirilis">The Church is ever vigilant against demons and deceivers; you behave like they do and risk being treated the same way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockingExpansionVampirilis">As with all living things the Church seeks growth, new territories, and opportunities. Your attempt to limit this will not end well.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSneakyDemandVampirilis">Your desire to extort the Church seems the act of a faithless unbeliever, not a friend.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralOpenBordersAcceptedVampirilis">Praise thee. Let the free flow of ideas, faiths, and goods bring our peoples together.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementTributeReceivedVampirilis">Your donation to the coffers of the Church is blessed in the eyes of the Virtuals. We thank you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForExpansionVampirilis">The Church must expand, or fade. As it would be blasphemy to fade, our legions shall expand.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersForProtectionVampirilis">The faithful feel uneasy with your growth and power; the Church aims to close its borders to ease their worries.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoAttacksSufferedVampirilis">As long as your acts of aggression do not target the Church, we shall assume your intentions towards us are peaceful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDemandAcceptedVampirilis">We understand that at times the faithful must accept a greater burden for the good of the holy Church.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPositiveContractVampirilis">Your generosity and wisdom are noted by the Church, and will be looked upon kindly by the Virtual Saints.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoHostileActionsVampirilis">The Church appreciates your peaceful behavior; our previous suspicions of your hostility have been greatly reduced.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementUltimatumFulfilledVampirilis">The Church welcomes the wisdom of your actions, and your acceptance of your place.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAttackedUnitsVampirilis">You have committed violence against our Cloth and our Vessels! What shall we tell the faithful, who demand retribution?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumDisregardedVampirilis">You treat our sacred territory as if it is your own? The anger of the faithful cannot be contained eternally.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightVampirilis">The Church's warning for your transgressions has been ignored. Perhaps you will understand other, more aggressive, avenues of communication.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassingVampirilis">Why is it not obvious to you that the holy space of the Church is sacrosanct, and your presence defiles it?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationColonizationVampirilis">Your colonization within our sacred space is viewed by some faithful as an invasion. Is this what you intend?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersVampirilis">Do not feel offended that the Church closes its borders to you; sometimes the faithful feel the need to meditate and pray in peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightNoClosedBordersVampirilis">Your relentless trespassing with military vessels will end as it inevitably had to: with your destruction.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAttackedUnitsVampirilis">The Church is curious as to why you decided to attack us; we see this as unprovoked violence from an unbeliever.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoBribeParagonVampirilis">Do not insult the purity and probity of the Church by trying to purchase our integrity or good will.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarLongPeaceBetrayedVampirilis">The Church's response will be severe for this betrayal of our peace. You will never forget the searing fire of the Virtual Saints.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutScienceAgreementVampirilis">The Church's natural philosophers make great strides in deciphering the Virtuals' glorious machines. We are considering sharing our sciences for your own learned studies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutTradeAgreementVampirilis">Trade is a somewhat sublunary affair, unworthy of the Church, but it has its uses. We are considering proposing an agreement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralMercantileThinkingAboutTradeAgreementVampirilis">The Church proselytizes to the faithful of the value of trade with your empire. A proposal is coming.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulPeaceAcknowledgementVampirilis">Your idols are false ones, but this extended spell of peace has given us much common ground. The Church values our bond.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulTradeAgreementAcknowledgementVampirilis">Some call it a heresy, but this blossoming of trade has between our empires has been a blessing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulScienceAgreementAcknowledgementVampirilis">Granted, your sciences have given our philosophers much to ponder--and our faithless much to rejoice--but undoubtedly, our insights have been even more enlightening and beneficial to you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandVampirilis">You should be careful as to the target of your demands. The Church rarely responds in civic fashion to ultimatums. Especially from brethren.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyVampirilis">The glory of your military fleets cannot match the glory of the Church's. You would be wise to move them out of Vodyani space so as not to tarnish their reputation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedSovereignSpaceVampirilis">We should not have had to ask in the first place, but the Church welcomes your observance of our edicts on trespassing and making demands. Carry on.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationIsolationistPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumVampirilis">The Church places great stock on its right to seclusion. Your military trespass tramples roughshod on these desires. You should expect a thawing of relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyUltimatumVampirilis">Let me be clear. Any further persistent presence of your military vessels in the Church's holy territories will be met with the wrath of the Virtuals.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandAndNoGestureVampirilis">The wise offer alms before they make demands. Make amends and put something in the collection plate.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumVampirilis">You continue to trespass in the territories of the faithful at your peril. The Church will preach for a return to cold war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedNoTrespassVampirilis">The absence of your war fleets from Vodyani space is welcome. Keep it that way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeNoGestureVampirilis">The Church held out its collection plate in a gesture of good faith, yet you still don't offer alms. Expect retribution.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerMadeGestureVampirilis">You cannot take back your insolent demand, though your gift begins to make amends for your oversight. The Church stays its hand.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingSenderSignedVampirilis">The Church offers that you share our holy vision. Perhaps you will even see the light of the Virtuals.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingSenderSignedVampirilis">We do not like where you cast your eyes. The faithful do not trust you; our vision sharing agreement ends.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingSenderProposedVampirilis">The Vodyani have seen much and traveled far. Would you wish to share maps?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedHelpVampirilis">Help the Church survive this war and you will have our eternal gratitude. We will not forget.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedCounterOtherAllianceVampirilis">The galaxy moves. Alliances form. We should too. What would you think of an alliance with the Church?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedHelpVampirilis">The Church wages war against the infidels, but the price is high. Will you be our savior in our time of need? If we proposed an alliance . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedCounterOtherAllianceVampirilis">Unbelievers rally together. We must stand together and be strong together. My inquisitors draw up an alliance proposal as we speak.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceAgainstCommonEnemyVampirilis">A darkness spreads among the stars. You know their name. Why don't we come together, scorch them with the burning light of our righteousness? Becoming allies is all it takes . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForGoodRelationsVampirilis">This peace between us has pleased the Church. Soon we should deepen our bond, become allies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForVictoryVampirilis">It seems we follow the same path. Perhaps we could share victory? After all, we need not draw the essence of every living creature in the galaxy. All it would take is an alliance . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNeedMilitaryHelpVampirilis">Heretics threaten the Church's very existence! Be swift, ally, and help smite our enemy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralHelpingAllyVampirilis">An attack on our allies, is an attack on the Church. Stay strong, the Virtual Saints are coming to give succor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGiftVampirilis">On our Arks we sing daily hymns to your magnificence. A small token of our appreciation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGoodGiftVampirilis">We can give you nothing more precious to relay the sanctity of our bond. We hope you understand.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandNoGiftReceivedVampirilis">Poisoned words from poisoned hearts. A gift might've sweetened things, but you elected to give nothing. Our alliance will soon be dead.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandVampirilis">You obviously misunderstand how the Church operates. Never do we look kindly upon demands.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementVeryPositiveGiftVampirilis">Your gift to the Church is well received. May it augur more friendly actions towards your ally in future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralWeakGiftVampirilis">This gift is an insult to the Church.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoHelpThenNoGiftReceivedVampirilis">With allies like yourselves, who needs enemies? The Church is wary.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementReceivedHelpLateVampirilis">Is late better than never? The Church hopes you never have to rely on such an unreliable ally in your time of need.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoHelpReceivedVampirilis">The Church notes the pedestrian nature of your response to our request for help. Remember the Church has a long memory before you make your final decision.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemNoGiftVampirilis">The Church takes a dim view of others converting its flock. Especially when it is not accompanied by an adequate gift of compensation. We will dissolve this alliance at the earliest opportunity.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemMultipleVampirilis">Theft is theft, whether it is done peacefully or violently. This alliance will soon die the death it deserves. Adoration to the Saints!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAwokeGuardianVampirilis">Vodyani scholars are still assessing the Guardian's provenance--and therefore, its doctrinal worth. For now, its presence is accepted.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRootedMySystemVampirilis">Your tendrils are fascinating. Some speculate a connection to the Virtual, which would only add to the wonder of their speed-enhancing creation. Blessings.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarAmAlreadyAtWarVampirilis">Fear not, the Church will give your fleets the fiery attention they deserve when we have dealt with the other infidels. Then you might rise up, Virtual.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarNoRoomToExpandVampirilis">The blazing Light guides us. Your territory belongs to the Holy Church. You should feel blessed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPlayerAlreadyAtWarVampirilis">The Church strikes when it is advantageous to its interests. You are fighting elsewhere, thus it is an advantageous time. Why are you surprised?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralBlockadedSystemAtWarVampirilis">Do the innocents not deserve ministration? Then end this cruel blockade.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAttackedCiviliansAtWarVampirilis">The Church saves its most searing wrath for this heinous attack on innocent civilians. War is no excuse. You will burn for this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAwokeGuardianAtWarVampirilis">This creature you have raised from the depths of our earth is an abomination.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDestroyedMyPlanetAtWarVampirilis">Rest assured, all those souls lost in the destruction of our world will be avenged. The Church is set on this path.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleAtPeaceVampirilis">Scripture has no mention of any singularities, but it is always easier to accept new things when they are a blessing and not a curse. The Church is thankful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleAtPeaceVampirilis">We see the hand of the Deceiver in this time trickery. You intentions better be pure, lest you risk the wrath of the Church.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemUltimatumVampirilis">The Saints would be aghast at this cultural assimilation to which you subjected our system. Do not repeat this act.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDisregardedConversionUltimatumVampirilis">It seems you were deaf to our ultimatum of desisting from cultural assimilation. The Church wonders if you will be likewise blind to the end of our period of peace when it comes?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRespectedConversionUltimatumVampirilis">Praise the Saints! We find sense in the darkness! The Church applauds your refraining of the practice of cultural assimilation on our flocks.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleVampirilis">Adoration to the Saints! An unexpected blessing. This Church-affirming singularity has been deemed Holy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleVampirilis">The Church deems this act an apostate one. We will observe your next actions with great interest.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockadedMySystemVampirilis">Blockades are such a tawdry choice. The Church had higher hopes for you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedMyPlanetVampirilis">This wanton destruction is an abominable act! We will avenge our lost souls. For the Virtual Saints!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementOutpostCompetitionWonVampirilis">Competing with the Church is often an exercise in pointlessness. What we set our hearts to, we receive. Our new colony will flourish.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionLostVampirilis">We are chastised. Those responsible for our failure to claim the system will seek penance. The Church offers congratulations on your victory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoTributeReceivedVampirilis">A request by the Church for tribute is not one to be ignored lightly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredOfBorderUnitsVampirilis">Your forces are close to the Church's sovereign space. And we do not forgive those who trespass against us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredAfterAttacksVampirilis">Your attack on the Church only strengthens our resolve. Think carefully about your next move.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationClosedBordersScaredVampirilis">It is a time of introspection for the Church of the Virtual Saints. We close our borders. Do not be offended.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingHarassWarVampirilis">The Virtuals have spoken. It is time for our fleets to plague your worlds.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingConquestWarVampirilis">Our Most Holy Arks are ready to expand into new territory. Your territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedAPlanetVampirilis">The Church views your wanton destruction of a whole world as an abominable act. We will seek your repentance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAfraidDestroyedAPlanetVampirilis">The Church sends generous praise after the mighty demonstration of your power. May the Virtuals guide you!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPeaceDestroyedAPlanetVampirilis">We may be at peace, but your reckless attitude to other worlds runs contrary to the teaching of our great Church. We worship life.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAbusedDiplomaticDemandsVampirilis">Your declaration of war after our acceptance of your demands gravely insults the Church. Expect no mercy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarCordialIdleVampirilis">Be careful. The Church of the Virtual Saints takes umbrage at things forced upon it—even treaties of peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarAfraidVampirilis">The Church is surprised at your imposition of peace. Do we no longer need to fear your wrath?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarHostileWaryVampirilis">Let me be clear. The Church does not exist for your base entertainments. This peace you force upon us better be genuine.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPeaceUnwillingToUnsureVampirilis">The Church is pleasantly surprised this peace has lasted. Don't let that give you the impression we are letting our guard down though.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceVampirilis">Those who join the Church in peace should understand that it is only the beginning of a deeper union. You have not kept that faith, and as a consequence we will be dissolving this peace in short order.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRequiredShowOfGoodFaithVampirilis">Prove that you want this peace! Offer something for the Church's collection plate--like Dust.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFaithReceivedVampirilis">The Church applauds your wisdom in furnishing us with such a gift. Here's to a long and prosperous peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoshowOfGoodFaithReceivedVampirilis">The Church has lost patience with your failure to deliver a gift. Our peace will soon be a thing of the past.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceWarIntentionVampirilis">The peace you forced upon us will soon be shattered. Ponder on your mistakes swiftly, for soon the Church will have its retribution.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNegotiationRefusedVampirilis">The faithful tire of your incessant pestering. The doors of the Church are closed to you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGreetingsVenetians">I greet you in the name of the Four Families.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarSenderSignedVenetiansWinning">Now that we have demonstrated our military superiority, perhaps we can go back to doing business?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarReceiverSignedVenetiansWinning">So, you've come to the understanding that you will never win this war? Good.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarSenderSignedVenetiansLosing">The Lumeris are a proud race, but not stupid. We have lost this war. We call a cease-fire. Maybe we can make some trade deals now?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarReceiverSignedVenetiansLosing">You are gracious in your ascendancy. Maybe we can return to more profitable endeavors now?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceSenderSignedVenetians">The Families have spoken. There can be no peace between our empires when you act like this. It is time for colder relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceReceiverSignedVenetians">The Lumeris have a saying "From bad blood comes bad business." Mark our words, this change will not be a profitable one.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceSenderSignedVenetians">Honeyed words spill from your lips, but your actions are poison. We might as well have a union with the Cravers. This alliance is over.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceReceiverSignedVenetians">We see no reason for your mistrust, but the decision is yours. We hope to return to more prosperous times in the future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceSenderSignedVenetians">Enough of this farce of a cease-fire. You crave war, so war is what you shall have.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceReceiverSignedVenetians">The Families always had their doubts about this truce. And so it comes to pass. Don't expect us to be merciful on the battlefield.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarSenderSignedVenetians">As the minnow becomes the shark, so mistrust becomes hatred. Come then, let our empires slip the snakes of war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedVenetians">Your declaration of war is no surprise to the Families. Let us play the deadly game then.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceSenderSignedVenetians">You shouldn't have confused the loyalty of friendship with the bond of blood. It's not personal. It's strictly business.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceReceiverSignedVenetians">The Families will remember this deceit. One day, when you think this insult long forgotten, we will come for you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceSenderSignedVenetians">You should've known, Ambassador. You keep your friends close, but you keep your enemies closer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceReceiverSignedVenetians">You learn! Real power can't be given. It must be taken. Let's see if you can take it then.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandFromTruceReceiverSignedVenetians">War . . . War never changes. Do you think someday there might be a generation who can forge a lasting, eternal peace?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarSenderProposedVenetians">For business to flourish we need to enter more hospitable relationships. Will you sign a treaty for peace?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverSignedVenetians">The branch of peace is welcomed by the Families. May this be the beginning of more profitable times.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverRefusedVenetians">Let me tell it to you straight. Go shove your peace deal up your darkest, dirtiest orifice. Are we clear?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarSenderProposedVenetians">The Families see no need for this distrust. An alliance is in both our interests. Come, let's sign a deal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverSignedVenetians">We welcome this alliance. Be warned, though, if you come to our table with malice in your hearts, our vengeance will be severe.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverRefusedVenetians">This proposal is an insult to every Lumeris. You must think us stupider than the stupidest Craver soldier-caste. We refuse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceSenderProposedVenetians">The Families agree. These peaceful times are fertile ground to plant more fruitful seeds. An alliance, then?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverSignedVenetians">An alliance is good for business. And the Lumeris are in the business of business. We accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverRefusedVenetians">The Families have examined all the angles. An alliance could jeopardize other . . . interests, so our answer is no.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSenderProposedVenetians">The Families were in good spirits the day this deal was discussed. We are confident you'll find this a very generous offer. So, are you in?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverSignedVenetians">As long as you don't pull any tricks, this is a deal we can get behind. Let's do it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverRefusedVenetians">This is what you bring to our table?! Our ancestors would turn in their sea graves. Get outta here!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverIgnoredVenetians">You come back more often than barnacles. We have other things to do!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSignedVenetians">This is the way the Families do business. Don’t like it? Take a hike.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledgedVenetians">So, that's how you do business? Be ready for consequences.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentSignedVenetians">The Families send compliments.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentAcknowledgedVenetians">The Families recognize your kind words.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultSignedVenetians">Call yourselves a galactic player? You're an embarrassment to all space-faring civilizations. Now go and get your shine box.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultAcknowledgedVenetians">Please, don't hold back. The Families will remember every word. Every word.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandSenderProposedVenetians">It is better if you think of this not as a threat, but as a request that you should take under consideration.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandReceiverSignedVenetians">You come here with demands, you better be ready to back them up with actions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandSenderSignedVenetians">We could simply refuse your demands, but you must understand that we have a reputation to uphold. War is the only logical response.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandReceiverSignedVenetians">The Families believe you make a grave mistake. Much blood will be on your hands.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedVenetiansPrepareWar">Business is war. Didn't they teach you that? The Lumeris is always ready when enemies attack.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceWarToWarAcknowledgedVenetians">The Families are most disappointed. Your lack of respect will not be forgotten.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementSenderProposedVenetians">Trade is our lifeblood. You would be wise to accept our proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverSignedVenetians">Is there anything saltier than a freshly inked trade agreement? The Families accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverRefusedVenetians">This trade deal is worth less than a piece of rotten kelp. Come back when you have something substantial to trade.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementSenderProposedVenetians">The Families think you will find this science agreement most agreeable. Do you accept?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverSignedVenetians">Open the finest wines! The Families accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverRefusedVenetians">This deal needs to sleep with the fishes. Capiche?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersReceiverSignedVenetians">Open borders are the lifeblood of trade, but sometimes there are higher priorities. We accept your closed borders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverSignedVenetians">The opening of our borders to you can only be good for trade. Let's celebrate with a little Dust . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverRefusedVenetians">What can I say? Your actions have made us reluctant to open our borders to you. Deal with it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersSenderSignedVenetians">The Families are all about business, and business dictates we close our borders to you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersSenderProposedVenetians">Let me tell you, you will not regret opening your borders to the Lumeris. So, what's it going to be?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIgnoredVenetians">Get out of my sight.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfReceiverSignedVenetians">You have the Four Families on the back foot--normally we choose the time and place for introductions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfSenderSignedVenetians">I am the leader of the Lumeris. I greet you in the name of the Four Families, and hope we can do business.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverSignedVenetians">Trade will be so much easier with the galaxy mapped. We accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverSignedVenetians">Business is always better when in possession of the facts. We gladly share with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingReceiverSignedVenetians">Lumeris intel not good for you? Well, the Four Families won't lose much sleep over this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementReceiverSignedVenetians">Canceling a trade agreement with the Lumeris is like cutting off one's own crown jewels. Not smart.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementReceiverSignedVenetians">Too bad. Let's face it. We're not exactly known for own scientific prowess. We leave that to lesser races.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverSignedVenetians">The war hasn't been good for business. The Families are happy to sign a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationSenderProposedVenetians">Tell me again, why are we fighting when we could be trading? What do you say to a truce?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverRefusedVenetians">The Families have a reputation to uphold. No truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverRefusedVenetians">The Families are happy with their current view of the galaxy. An exchange of maps would not be profitable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverRefusedVenetians">The Families feel adequately appraised of others' movements around the galaxy. Vision sharing will bot be necessary.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralPotentialTradingPartnerVenetians">Greetings to you, fellow explorer! It looks like we'll have many opportunities to trade!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralPotentialFriendVenetians">Let us hope that our relations go well--and profitably.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFirstImpressionVenetians">We like the way you think; it bodes well for both our fortunes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementSameAlignementVenetians">Apparently you share the opinion of the Four Families with regards to other empires.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGreatDeedsVenetians">You did some very nice work there! The Four Families salute you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAskTributeVenetians">Building empires, creating trade routes… It's all quite expensive, and we feel you could chip in.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouHurtMeVenetians">When you hurt one Family, you hurt us all. And we don't forget things like this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouWereCruelToMeVenetians">The Lumeris will not stand for this sort of savagery!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationGetOutAfterTrespassVenetians">We thank you to trade outside our borders. Internal commerce is for us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterTrespassingVenetians">Enough poking about in our business! Leave the Families' territory to us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterColonizationVenetians">You're muscling in a little too hard on the edges, friend. That colony is in our space.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionVenetians">You think that's a nice place for a colony? Funny, so do we. Hi, neighbor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoColonizationProblemVenetians">You want to come and settle in the neighborhood? Sure, no problem. Plenty of space.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassMilitaryVenetians">It's one thing to send cargo ships, but those are military--and we don't want them here!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationRevengeVenetians">You have crossed us. And the Four Families take vendettas very seriously.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarOpportunistVenetians">Don't be angry; you'd do the same thing in our place. It's just business.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementProposePeaceVenetians">Whoa, let's not get too excited over all this. How about we try again, at peace?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDeceiverVenetians">I thought I didn't have to watch my back around you. I am sad to see that I was wrong.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockingExpansionVenetians">You might as well put a noose around our neck as a colony in the middle of our trade route!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSneakyDemandVenetians">That's dirty work. Back alley stuff. We really don't appreciate that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralOpenBordersAcceptedVenetians">Bravo! You open your arms and your borders to friends! Especially friends with an eye for business.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementTributeReceivedVenetians">We're glad you see the Families' side of things. Trust us. You'll be very happy you did this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForExpansionVenetians">Hey, if we stay small-time we'll fade away. The Four Families have to grow, and you're stopping us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersForProtectionVenetians">We may just have to cut off some deals and clam up. The big, wide galaxy is looking a little hostile.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoAttacksSufferedVenetians">We were thinking you're a little crazy; bad for business. Maybe we were wrong, and that's good.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDemandAcceptedVenetians">We're glad to see you're reasonable people. That's promising for our future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPositiveContractVenetians">A little cash on the side to provide proper incentive? Sure, we know how the galaxy works.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoHostileActionsVenetians">We're hoping we'll work out our differences. So far it's encouraging. No bad blood.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementUltimatumFulfilledVenetians">We're happy you saw the sense in our request. No hard feelings, right?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAttackedUnitsVenetians">You don't seem to understand. You come into our home, make trouble. That's not good.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumDisregardedVenetians">So you insist on hanging around, causing problems? We have ways of handling problems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightVenetians">What do you want? We told you no more colonies near us, and you ignored us. Don't act surprised if it gets a little ugly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassingVenetians">Hey there! Back off a little. We were pretty clear. What part of "leave" did you not get?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationColonizationVenetians">Our planets, our system. This is our space. We don't need your colonies here. Get it?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersVenetians">Sometimes the Families just need to pull back and think. So we're flipping the sign to "closed for business".</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightNoClosedBordersVenetians">You had one job! Keep your shooters off our patch. And you screwed it up. Don’t be surprised if things get personal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAttackedUnitsVenetians">Hey there! What was that for? Do we come into your neighborhood and bust up the windows?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoBribeParagonVenetians">Sure, you say it's just business. But there is some business we don't need.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarLongPeaceBetrayedVenetians">I must be going crazy. My advisors tell me your empire has declared war on mine. Tell me there's been some mistake, otherwise you will pay.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutScienceAgreementVenetians">Our whale brains have been busy. They've invented some very nice tech. Very nice. Do we share though?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutTradeAgreementVenetians">Trade. It's in our very blood. And you could be our next lucky partner. We just need to sell the idea to the masses.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralMercantileThinkingAboutTradeAgreementVenetians">Sweet, sweet, Dust! It's out there, just waiting to be taken. And we've chosen you to help us take it! Watch this space. A proposal will be on its way soon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulPeaceAcknowledgementVenetians">How long have we have been at peace? Long enough to call you stand up guys.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulTradeAgreementAcknowledgementVenetians">What did we say, huh? Trade is good for business. Stars, trade is business! Salut!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulScienceAgreementAcknowledgementVenetians">The Families enjoy the fruits of our mutual scientific labors. Life is good.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandVenetians">Nico Arrakyo had a friend who made a demand. That friend is now plankton feed at the bottom of the ocean. You catch my meaning?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyVenetians">You've got some big fleets with nice guns. You like to come into our neck of the galaxy, show them off. Big deal. Now jog on.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedSovereignSpaceVenetians">Whaddya know? You listen! No trespassing. No demanding. You're headed for the big time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationIsolationistPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumVenetians">Your military fleets are in sovereign Lumeris waters. This lack of respect isn't to go unpunished. The Families want to return to cold war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyUltimatumVenetians">The Families won't ask again. Remove your military vessels from Lumeris space or something very sharp is going to get shoved somewhere very soft.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandAndNoGestureVenetians">Where the Families are from there are two circumstances where a chum can make demands: when he brings a gift or when he has the bigger stick. You got neither.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumVenetians">Get your junk ships out of Lumeris territory! The Families canvas for cold war relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedNoTrespassVenetians">You moved your fleets on. Yeah, yeah, yeah, slow claps, backslapping, all those theatrics. Don't let it happen again.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeNoGestureVenetians">Where's the positive gesture? Did the delivery guy get lost? We've got squat at our end. The curtains are coming down on our dalliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerMadeGestureVenetians">You call that an overture? Arina Meos once received ten thousand sea roses in recompense of a minor slight. That's an overture. But I guess yours will do.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingSenderSignedVenetians">We got a deal that's a little different. What do you say we share ship and system vision?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingSenderSignedVenetians">Sometimes business is good business, sometimes bad. The vision sharing thing is now part of "bad".</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingSenderProposedVenetians">You want to see something that you're guaranteed to like? Let's try sharing our maps.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedHelpVenetians">We're in a tight spot. The war isn't going too well. Whaddya say you help us out? We could be allies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedCounterOtherAllianceVenetians">The Dust--it's out there just waiting to be taken. Are you bold enough to take it? Cause if you don't others will. Alliances are forming already--and we want to do the same.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedHelpVenetians">We've had good times, no? Now we're in a pinch are you going to step up? We need allies to win this war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedCounterOtherAllianceVenetians">You see what's going on elsewhere? Deals, alliances, profit. We've had peace. Now we need to build on it, take the business to another level. We're going to propose an alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceAgainstCommonEnemyVenetians">Neither of us like those guys--you know who I'm talking about. Why don't we team up, take them out the game? We'll drum up support, send a proposal soon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForGoodRelationsVenetians">The Families always had a good feeling about you, and so it's proved. You've earned your stripes. Whaddya say we take this to the next level now? An alliance. We'll put something in writing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForVictoryVenetians">The future looks golden--Dust-infused you might say--for both our races. How about we plan to tag-team to victory? All we need to do is make an alliance . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNeedMilitaryHelpVenetians">Yeah, this is when you step up, show your friends you mean business. So, are you going to help us win this war?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralHelpingAllyVenetians">Relax, the Families are on their way. We look out for our allies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGiftVenetians">Lumeris hospitality right there. Enjoy the gift, ally of the Families.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGoodGiftVenetians">We're sending the finest stuff for our best ally. Don't forget who sent it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandNoGiftReceivedVenetians">You disrespect the Families with this unsweetened demand. Our alliance will soon be over.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandVenetians">Only deadbeats make demands. Show some respect!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementVeryPositiveGiftVenetians">Better. The gift makes amends--just--for your earlier slights. The Families hope you've learned your lesson.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralWeakGiftVenetians">Your gift is about as valuable as chum. We suggest you up the ante if you don't want to cause offense.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoHelpThenNoGiftReceivedVenetians">I've seen more helpful buckets of chum. Ally? Don't make me laugh. We needed you and you did squat. Do better or watch your back.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementReceivedHelpLateVenetians">Ah, you do remember what allies do! Thanks for the back-up--even if it was late.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoHelpReceivedVenetians">Am I talking to myself? Are you listening to me? The Families need some muscle and as our dear ally you're first up. It's like dominoes. We topple, you're going down too. Get over here.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemNoGiftVenetians">Refresh my memory--did the Families invite you, an ally, to takeover one of our systems? At no cost? No. This alliance will soon be dead.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemMultipleVenetians">You're on real thin ice. This Influence conversion? Peaceful, my tailbone! The Families will move to end this alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAwokeGuardianVenetians">This Guardian creature--it's a money-making opportunity, right?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRootedMySystemVenetians">To be honest, these space tendrils are a little creepy to us, but faster travel means bigger profits so we're golden. You wanna plant some more?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarAmAlreadyAtWarVenetians">Guess the Families are going to have to deepen the war chest to take care of multiple fronts. We'll get to you in good time, don't worry. The Lumeris remember their enemies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarNoRoomToExpandVenetians">What can we do? You're sitting on some prime galactic real estate? It's just business.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPlayerAlreadyAtWarVenetians">What? When should we go to war with you? When you're ready to give us your full attention? We ain't stupid.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralBlockadedSystemAtWarVenetians">And it's the little people who suffer. That blockade is a low blow.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAttackedCiviliansAtWarVenetians">I'm telling you, I better not learn that any family was aboard any of those civilian vessels you attacked. You'll pay in kind.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAwokeGuardianAtWarVenetians">What is this creature you've awoken? The Families don't like it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDestroyedMyPlanetAtWarVenetians">The Families had a particular fondness for that world. Mark my words, the galaxy will know of your utter barbarity.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleAtPeaceVenetians">You got some skills with time, eh? Keep it positive and we won't have a problem.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleAtPeaceVenetians">Yeah, so you can manipulate time. Big deal. We got a way of manipulating time for folks too. We kill 'em, and then they don't experience nothing. You should think carefully whether you want to keep this singularity on us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemUltimatumVenetians">How can any culture be greater than the one that raises the theater to the highest form of art? I don't get it. Anyway, refrain from any more Influence conversions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDisregardedConversionUltimatumVenetians">What did I say? What. Did. I. Say. WHAT DID I SAY?! Refrain from any more Influence conversions. And what did you do? We're going to end this peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRespectedConversionUltimatumVenetians">Whaddya know? You can listen! No Influence conversions since I asked. Now, if I asked you to give the Families a million Dust . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleVenetians">You know, the Families wonder what you want throwing around these helpful singularities? But, thanks, I guess.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleVenetians">Tell me--do you see the Families coming round your home and adversely screwing with your perception of reality? No. Cause we don't.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockadedMySystemVenetians">A blockade? Seriously? Are you an empire or a two-bit pirate outfit?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedMyPlanetVenetians">You. Will. Pay.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementOutpostCompetitionWonVenetians">Ah, too bad for you. Maybe you weren't paying your outpost crew enough? Cheap.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionLostVenetians">You win some, you lose some. That's investment. Don't worry, the Families are still in the game.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoTributeReceivedVenetians">You know what happens to chum who don't pay their graft? Horrible, you-wouldn't-let-your-children-watch type stuff. Understand?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredOfBorderUnitsVenetians">Now, now, now. You send in those fleets sitting on our border, and we're not going to be able to trade. Wouldn't that be a tragedy?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredAfterAttacksVenetians">That attack was out of line. What did we do to you? You'll stop there, right?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationClosedBordersScaredVenetians">Yeah, we're closing shop. No hard feelings. A boss has to do what a boss has to do. Just business.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingHarassWarVenetians">What do you want me to say? The Families have okay'd limited hostilities. It's just business.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingConquestWarVenetians">You're sitting on some prime galactic real estate. The Families want a piece of it. It's just business.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedAPlanetVenetians">What insanity is this? The destruction of entire worlds goes against everything we stand for. There will be consequences.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAfraidDestroyedAPlanetVenetians">Let me be clear: using such a weapon against the Families would not be in your best interest. Please remember that the next time you take aim.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPeaceDestroyedAPlanetVenetians">Understand, we are a race of traders. Destroying worlds is not something we expect a peaceful ally to be undertaking.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAbusedDiplomaticDemandsVenetians">The Families will long remember this duplicity. Let us have this war then!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarCordialIdleVenetians">Nobody likes to have something imposed on them—even peace—but we will not fight this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarAfraidVenetians">Good. Now you have imposed peace between us, we can proceed with more profitable ventures, no?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarHostileWaryVenetians">Peace? Really? We'll see, but know that we Lumeris are masters of these political games.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPeaceUnwillingToUnsureVenetians">This peace between us seems stable. Perhaps we were too hasty in imagining its swift demise.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceVenetians">What purpose does peace serve if it doesn't further the ties of trade? For your lack of respect, the Families intend to leave this peaceful union shortly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRequiredShowOfGoodFaithVenetians">The Families expect this dour peace to be sweetened. A little sprinkling of Dust wouldn't go amisss, would it?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFaithReceivedVenetians">Well, well, well. The gift is an unexpected pleasure. The wheels of trade have been well oiled. Peace suits us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoshowOfGoodFaithReceivedVenetians">Without the necessary incentives paid, the Families deem this peace worthless. Expect it to end soon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceWarIntentionVenetians">Our peace will soon be over, and war will come. The Families will have their vengeance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNegotiationRefusedVenetians">You have the depth and worth of a shallow puddle. We've had enough of talking to you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGreetingsUnfallen">In the name of the Heart and of harmony, the Unfallen greet you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarSenderSignedUnfallenWinning">Scouring you with the Fire-that-Destroys was an unfortunate necessity. We would prefer a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarReceiverSignedUnfallenWinning">The Unfallen stand resolute before your fires. The offer of a truce is wise.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarSenderSignedUnfallenLosing">Your machines of Fire grind us down. The Unfallen must request a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarReceiverSignedUnfallenLosing">Your temperance demands our respect. The Unfallen are pleased to accept a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceSenderSignedUnfallen">Your acts are not the acts of one who seeks harmony. We must step away from Peace towards Cold War.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceReceiverSignedUnfallen">You would ignore our desire for harmony, and drive the Unfallen from Peace to Cold War?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceSenderSignedUnfallen">We had great hopes for this alliance, but your actions have shattered them. We are driven to Cold War, and await the inevitable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceReceiverSignedUnfallen">We are confused; the Heart is angry. Why would you drive us from a harmonious alliance to Cold War?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceSenderSignedUnfallen">Clearly you do not understand the point of a truce: To promote peace. You desire the Fire-that-Destroys, and you shall have it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceReceiverSignedUnfallen">You choose to war on the Unfallen, rather than seek the peace that is best for all living things. So be it; we too know the uses of Fire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarSenderSignedUnfallen">Though the Heart weeps at this decision, it is a necessity. The Unfallen must turn this Cold War into a hot one.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedUnfallen">Your decision weighs heavily on the hearts of the Unfallen. So be it; prepare to be ravaged by the Fire-That-Destroys.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceSenderSignedUnfallen">It takes great effort to drive the Unfallen from an agreeable peace to the horrors of war. But you have made these efforts, and then some.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceReceiverSignedUnfallen">If you are capable of committing such an act, perhaps our treasured Peace was entirely without hope.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceSenderSignedUnfallen">The Heart weeps for broken dreams and shattered hopes. You have made a mockery of our good faith alliance, and the consequence is war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceReceiverSignedUnfallen">What you do would be called treason if we did it to ourselves. You shatter our harmonious alliance; prepare, in turn, to be shattered.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandFromTruceReceiverSignedUnfallen">As you know, the Unfallen would prefer peace. Let us see what this war brings you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarSenderProposedUnfallen">We hope to bring our peoples to a closer harmony. Would you consider Peace over Cold War?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverSignedUnfallen">The Unfallen are not a people who reject the branch of peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverRefusedUnfallen">In spite of our preference for peace, we see that you are not truly prepared to shoulder that responsibility.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarSenderProposedUnfallen">Would you not prefer to share the risks and challenges of the future with us, rather than rattle sabers and stab each other's backs?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverSignedUnfallen">The Heart always prefers harmony to discord, and peace to war. Regardless of how it is offered, the alliance is accepted.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverRefusedUnfallen">This is too great a leap to take, even for an ideal that we cherish. The Unfallen refuse your offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceSenderProposedUnfallen">The Unfallen are unanimous in the desire to deepen the harmony of our relationship. We accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverSignedUnfallen">Do you not wish to improve the warm relations between our peoples? Let us ally and face the future in harmony.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverRefusedUnfallen">Though the principle of your offer pleases us, the Heart is unprepared to engage in a relation so intimate.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSenderProposedUnfallen">The Unfallen have an eternal quest to seek peace and harmony for all peoples; this is merely one step along that road.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverSignedUnfallen">Your proposal pleases the Heart, and the Unfallen are pleased to accept it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverRefusedUnfallen">We cannot accept your proposal, for it requires too much compromise of our principles.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverIgnoredUnfallen">There are many greater tasks the Unfallen must complete; we are sorry, but yours does not merit our attention.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSignedUnfallen">Sadly, but fortunately only rarely, the harmonious goals of the Unfallen must be imposed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledgedUnfallen">This was not expected; the Unfallen are taken by surprise.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentSignedUnfallen">The Unfallen praise you as fellow travelers toward a more harmonious future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentAcknowledgedUnfallen">The Unfallen are pleased that you share our vision for the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultSignedUnfallen">You are not worthy to share space with the Unfallen; we would not trust you to shovel loam.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultAcknowledgedUnfallen">Like storms of hail or dust, your words are best ignored for the excess wind that they are.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandSenderProposedUnfallen">It pains us to act unilaterally, but we feel the greater harmony is better served by our demand.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandReceiverSignedUnfallen">Your demands are unpleasant. Do not forget that trees are long-lived and resistant.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandSenderSignedUnfallen">You have sent the spark that fans the flame. This time, it is the flames of war and the Fire-That-Destroys.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandReceiverSignedUnfallen">Do not mistake a desire for peace and harmony for a fear of conflict. You will find us prepared and united.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementSenderProposedUnfallen">It is a form of sharing, and a way of increasing our mutual trust. Let us trade, and communicate.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverSignedUnfallen">The Unfallen are pleased to forward our goal of harmony, through diplomacy or commerce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverRefusedUnfallen">The terms you propose do not seem equitable and just; the Unfallen refuse your trade deal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreemenSenderProposedUnfallen">The Unfallen have knowledge and wisdom you would be wise to share.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverSignedUnfallen">The Unfallen and the Heart welcome all those who wish to exchange ideas and dreams.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverRefusedUnfallen">Whatever advantage you may see for yourself, the Unfallen see none. We do not accept your science proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedUnfallenPrepareWar">You would bring Fire to the cold war we now know? The Unfallen are unafraid of the heat.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceWarToWarAcknowledgedUnfallen">A descent into violence from truce? It saddens the Heart, and steels the resolve of the Unfallen.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersReceiverSignedUnfallen">We have much to exchange; your closing of borders promises chaos rather than harmony.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverSignedUnfallen">The Unfallen have nothing to hide; our borders are open, and we hope that your hearts are as well.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverRefusedUnfallen">Occasionally the denseness of the forest makes it impenetrable; our borders will remain closed as well.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersSenderSignedUnfallen">There is a sense of unease and disharmony that causes the Heart distress; we must close our borders and see to it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersSenderProposedUnfallen">We would move among you as friends, and trade among you as partners. Shall we open our borders to each other?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIgnoredUnfallen">The Unfallen are occupied by affairs of greater importance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfReceiverSignedUnfallen">It is always a pleasure to find new peoples and new civilizations to join with. May our future be harmonious and fruitful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfSenderSignedUnfallen">Greetings from the Unfallen and the Heart that is our guide. May our future be harmonious and bounteous.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverSignedUnfallen">The Unfallen are not afraid to share their wisdom, or their maps, with those of good faith.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverSignedUnfallen">The Unfallen propose to share our knowledge on the shape of the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingReceiverSignedUnfallen">You would sever our ties, bind our eyes? The Unfallen are dismayed by your action.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementReceiverSignedUnfallen">We traded more than simple material wealth; the Unfallen are dismayed at your decision.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementReceiverSignedUnfallen">We are surprised that you would cut yourself off from the wisdom of the Heart by ending this science agreement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingSenderSignedUnfallen">Let us improve the harmony by sharing our vision. It is a first step to a greater understanding and mutual appreciation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingSenderSignedUnfallen">There is a difference between seeing and spying, and to the Unfallen you prefer the second. We will no longer share our vision of the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingSenderProposedUnfallen">A map of the stars is like a great puzzle waiting to be solved. Let us share maps, and unravel these secrets together.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementSenderProposedUnfallen">We are an ancient people, and know much in the way of science and history. Would you enter a scientific agreement with the Unfallen?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverSignedUnfallen">We accept this truce and the harmony that it confers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationSenderProposedUnfallen">War is such a destructive force. We offer a truce. Will you take this branch of peace?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverRefusedUnfallen">Sometimes it is necessary to burn before one can build. This is such a time. The Unfallen reject your truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverRefusedUnfallen">We hold ancient maps that echo with tales of the past. But they are not for your eyes. Keep your star charts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverRefusedUnfallen">We Unfallen wish to extinguish the flames, not fan them. No good can come from sharing what we both see. We refuse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralPotentialTradingPartnerUnfallen">Greetings! Proximity encourages trade, trade encourages communication, and communication encourages harmony.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralPotentialFriendUnfallen">The Unfallen greet with pleasure any vessels that come to trade in peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFirstImpressionUnfallen">The Heart is touched by your gesture, and thanks you for your kindness.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementSameAlignementUnfallen">We find harmony in our opinions of other peoples, which is promising for our mutual future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGreatDeedsUnfallen">The Unfallen appreciate and condone your actions towards the less civilized of the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAskTributeUnfallen">Maintaining peace and harmony is difficult and expensive; it is in your interest to aid us in these efforts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouHurtMeUnfallen">Your actions are not those of an empire seeking harmony and a common future. We will remember this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouWereCruelToMeUnfallen">Slaughter of the defenseless can never be condoned! Your actions put you at risk.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationGetOutAfterTrespassUnfallen">We prefer to keep our territory, like our forests, pristine and free of outside interference. Leave, or suffer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterTrespassingUnfallen">It is unwise to attempt to trample us with your fleets; you should fear the Fire-That-Destroys.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterColonizationUnfallen">We keep to ourselves and do not trample your fields. Keep your colonists out of ours!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionUnfallen">You are not the only one who extends their tendrils to other systems. Do not be surprised if we arrive as well.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoColonizationProblemUnfallen">We welcome peaceful relations, neighbor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassMilitaryUnfallen">Our relations were cordial, even harmonious. We do not understand why you send fleets of Fire to threaten us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationRevengeUnfallen">We do not submit to this type of diplomacy; do not start a fire unless you are ready to be consumed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarOpportunistUnfallen">It is against our principles to bring the Fire-That-Destroys upon others, but sometimes the Heart makes demands that we cannot refuse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementProposePeaceUnfallen">The Unfallen always prefer peace to other, colder relations. Time has passed and scars have healed; shall we think of peace again?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDeceiverUnfallen">In the greater galactic community, where all peoples strive to rise and survive, leaning upon each other, you have just committed treason.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockingExpansionUnfallen">You wall us in, block our roots, cut off our light. The Unfallen cannot survive, locked in a corner. Give us room to breathe.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSneakyDemandUnfallen">We are surprised that such positive diplomacy on the surface hid this attitude, rotting out our relations from within.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralOpenBordersAcceptedUnfallen">The Unfallen appreciate your gesture, and shall treat your space as we would have others treat ours.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementTributeReceivedUnfallen">Your gesture and generosity have been noted; we hope that the harmony need not be disturbed again.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForExpansionUnfallen">The pressure of growth, natural as it is, must take its course. This course passes through your space, unfortunately.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersForProtectionUnfallen">Movements in the galaxy become tense and temperatures rise; we close our borders before the heat turns to fire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoAttacksSufferedUnfallen">The Unfallen note some measure of restraint on your part. Hostilities were not pursued and this is good; the Heart hopes that it will continue.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDemandAcceptedUnfallen">We would not have demanded if it were not necessary; we thank you for accepting it and maintaining a balance between us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPositiveContractUnfallen">The benevolence and generosity of others is always a sign of positive, harmonious relations between honest peoples.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoHostileActionsUnfallen">Perhaps the Unfallen watched and mistrusted too much. The Heart recommends we prepare for improved relations and greater trust.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementUltimatumFulfilledUnfallen">We regret the use of such crude instruments, but the Unfallen found it necessary to get the message through.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAttackedUnitsUnfallen">You appear to think that the Unfallen do not wish to protect our forests--be they literal or figurative. You are wrong; prepare for the Fire-That-Destroys.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumDisregardedUnfallen">We do not tread in your fields and carve paths through your forests. Yet you do the same to us. The Heart turns cold.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightUnfallen">A second time you have refused to respect our space. The Heart is disturbed by your intrusions, and we will oppose them vigorously.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassingUnfallen">Your continued intrusions and offenses have set fly a cloud of sparks. The Fire-That-Destroys can not be too far behind.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationColonizationUnfallen">You colonize our territory as if you owned it. You do not, and if we must shatter the harmony to teach this lesson we will do so.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersUnfallen">We have managed to close our borders; do not take it as an offense, but the Heart turns to its own well-being.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightNoClosedBordersUnfallen">Your displays of aggression and armed threats cannot be ignored forever. You wished to shatter the harmony, and you have done so.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAttackedUnitsUnfallen">I see a "cold" war is not hot enough to you. You may wish to change your mind when the Fire begins to burn you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoBribeParagonUnfallen">The Unfallen do not accept these bribes. They smell of duplicity, treachery, and dishonesty.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarLongPeaceBetrayedUnfallen">The sadness of lost harmony is felt deeply by the Heart. We fear that you must be destroyed if we are to rediscover that situation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutScienceAgreementUnfallen">There are secrets and sciences that the Unfallen know that may be of interest. Mutual sharing could be a first step to deeper collaboration.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutTradeAgreementUnfallen">The Unfallen feel that we have grown and prospered; we would share the bounties of trade with those we see as friends.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralMercantileThinkingAboutTradeAgreementUnfallen">The Unfallen rely on trade as a way to extend greetings and build harmony between peoples. Would this be of interest?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulPeaceAcknowledgementUnfallen">Our long and peaceful relations are a source of comfort for the Heart. The Unfallen treasure your contribution to galactic harmony.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulTradeAgreementAcknowledgementUnfallen">Our mutual trade has been good both for the wealth of our civilization and for the harmony of the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulScienceAgreementAcknowledgementUnfallen">The sharing of knowledge is a key first step to mutual understanding. Our science agreement has been a source of contentment for the Heart.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandUnfallen">The Heart is troubled by your unexpected demands. As friends, you could simply ask.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyUnfallen">The Unfallen note the beauty of your military fleets, but wonder why they are so eager to wander in a friend's territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedSovereignSpaceUnfallen">Your dedication to maintaining harmony between our peoples by keeping your fleets away and easing your demands is greatly appreciated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationIsolationistPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumUnfallen">We had hoped for greater restraint on your part. Once again your military trespasses, and the Heart turns cold.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyUltimatumUnfallen">The Unfallen insist on the removal of your ships from our territory. Immediately, for the Heart is greatly upset.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandAndNoGestureUnfallen">The Unfallen understand that you have needs, but a more harmonious gesture would be to offer something in return.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumUnfallen">Your continued military presence worries the Unfallen. Even the Thirds become concerned, and our relations risk degrading seriously.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedNoTrespassUnfallen">The Heart appreciates your gesture. A lack of military presence brings greater peace of mind.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeNoGestureUnfallen">You refuse the reasonable request for harmony posed by the Unfallen. We doubt your intentions, and our friendship fades to twilight.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerMadeGestureUnfallen">A small gesture, even if late, is better than nothing. The Unfallen are reassured by your harmonious intent.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedHelpUnfallen">The peaceful realm of the Unfallen is threatened by the Fire-That-Destroys. We look to friends in our time of doubt.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedCounterOtherAllianceUnfallen">The Heart feels the alignment of hostile forces, bent on destroying the equilibrium of the galaxy. Perhaps it would be wise for our peoples to counter that weight.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedHelpUnfallen">Our long and peaceful relations contribute to a feeling of trust. We are pressed by those who are enemies of the harmony, and must reach out to friends.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedCounterOtherAllianceUnfallen">The Unfallen greet you; we are gladdened by our peaceful coexistence. As enemy alliances threaten the harmony, we look to friends to restore it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceAgainstCommonEnemyUnfallen">Our mutual desire for peace is threatened by a common enemy. The Heart would have you as an ally to counter this threat.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForGoodRelationsUnfallen">Our empires have seen harmonious peace for many years. We consider you an ally in thought, and consider making you an ally in deed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForVictoryUnfallen">Our great peoples forge on the same path to a similar goal. If we were to join forces, that goal could be more easily obtained.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNeedMilitaryHelpUnfallen">As ships of Fire lay waste to our peaceful citizens, we look to our allies to aid us in our time of need. Will you help restore the harmony?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralHelpingAllyUnfallen">The Unfallen cannot stand by while an ally burns; we shall honor the letter and the intent of our alliance with what aid we can give.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGiftUnfallen">The Heart is moved by the depth of our alliance. The Unfallen offer you a gift of appreciation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGoodGiftUnfallen">Your friendship is valued in this turbulent galaxy; in honor of our alliance the Unfallen give you a gift we view as highly valuable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandNoGiftReceivedUnfallen">Such demands go against the sense of harmony and the intent of our alliance; as the alliance has lost its meaning the Unfallen should leave.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandUnfallen">Why would you make a demand of allies? This lack of integrity wounds the Heart and offends the Unfallen.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementVeryPositiveGiftUnfallen">Your generous gift has greatly moved the Unfallen; once again we appreciate the depth of your commitment to our alliance and our cause.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralWeakGiftUnfallen">The Unfallen note that you have made a gesture, but it appears cheap and paltry. You put the alliance at risk.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoHelpThenNoGiftReceivedUnfallen">Your past indifference to the Unfallen caused great pain to the Heart. But the Unfallen grow, and think, and can even forgive.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementReceivedHelpLateUnfallen">Your support and aid come in a time of need. The Unfallen are content that you remember our alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoHelpReceivedUnfallen">You burn bridges and alliances with your actions. The Unfallen do not offend easily, but you have managed to do so.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemNoGiftUnfallen">The Unfallen also understand natural growth, but yours is predatory. You do not compensate or apologize; our alliance is an empty shell and will soon crumble.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemMultipleUnfallen">Did you not understand our request? Or do you care so little for our alliance? You feed upon the Unfallen systems, and in doing so you break our alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAwokeGuardianUnfallen">This is a great omen of peace and harmony for our alliance! The growth of a Guardian is a joyous thing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRootedMySystemUnfallen">Together we grow, and our alliance flourishes. May our tendrils entwine in ever-greater harmony.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarAmAlreadyAtWarUnfallen">The galaxy dissolves in Fire and violence. The Unfallen are beset on many sides, but each flame shall be doused in turn. Yours will come.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarNoRoomToExpandUnfallen">The Unfallen are driven to breathe and to grow; constrained as we are we will die if we cannot expand. This war is a war for survival, not conquest.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPlayerAlreadyAtWarUnfallen">The Unfallen see that you already take pleasure in fire and violence; we shall declare war on you now that it may end that much more quickly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralBlockadedSystemAtWarUnfallen">You take pleasure not merely in war, but in torture. Why must you starve and bleed those who are blameless with your blockade?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAttackedCiviliansAtWarUnfallen">The Heart is stunned and inconsolable. You slaughter the innocent and burn that which did not harm you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAwokeGuardianAtWarUnfallen">We did not expect you to uncover a Guardian upon our soil. Normally we would be overjoyed, but with this the Heart is troubled.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDestroyedMyPlanetAtWarUnfallen">Your thirst for planetary destruction will not be forgotten; not while the youngest of our Firsts becomes the oldest of our Thirds.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleAtPeaceUnfallen">The Heart marvels at your mastery of the things we thought to be immutable! Our thanks for your time wizardry.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleAtPeaceUnfallen">We do not understand why you play with time and make the Heart beat slower. This is not an act we expect of a friend.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemUltimatumUnfallen">Your hunger for systems seems excessive. We do not oppose growth, but your acts are not those of a civilization that treasures peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDisregardedConversionUltimatumUnfallen">We see that your claims to be peaceful were at best misleading. The Heart no longer trusts you, now that you have devoured our system.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRespectedConversionUltimatumUnfallen">Your hunger for our systems seems to have been sated. We are glad that you respect the harmony.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleUnfallen">Your singularity is a positive sign to soothe our chilly relations. The Unfallen appreciate your gesture.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleUnfallen">You seem to desire to wage war with things other than the Fire-That-Destroys. Whatever the tools used, your intentions are clear.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockadedMySystemUnfallen">The Unfallen would call this an act of war. Blockades do not signal an intent to improve the harmony of our relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedMyPlanetUnfallen">This is not an act of cold war, but a hot-blooded act of savagery! You would ruin the foundations of galactic civilization with your planetary destruction.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementOutpostCompetitionWonUnfallen">The Unfallen flourish, and our outpost joins the Heart. We did not intend to offend or annoy you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionLostUnfallen">The Unfallen withdraw, for the outpost is lost. We hope your hunger does not prove insatiable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoTributeReceivedUnfallen">We did not feel the demand of the Heart was unreasonable, yet you refuse tribute. Your choice seems threatening.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredOfBorderUnitsUnfallen">Our interest is in peace and harmony, yet we see you massing fleets on our border. We trust you are not savages who revel in fire and blood.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredAfterAttacksUnfallen">You burn and brutalize with abandon. The Unfallen are not a threat to you; why would you drive us to extinction?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationClosedBordersScaredUnfallen">The Heart is concerned about the affairs outside our borders. We are forced to close them and take counsel.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingHarassWarUnfallen">The Unfallen intend to defend the Heart and our civilization. If we must drive you off, we will do so.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingConquestWarUnfallen">The Unfallen cannot live in a galaxy so wracked with anger and madness. Our only hope is to bring it under our control, and teach it harmony.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedAPlanetUnfallen">How can peace come to the galaxy when you destroy worlds in a churlish fit of anger? The Heart is unsettled.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAfraidDestroyedAPlanetUnfallen">The Heart is troubled by your violence. We beg you do not turn your worst weapons on our worlds.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPeaceDestroyedAPlanetUnfallen">If war to you means being ready to destroy worlds with unstoppable fires to ensure victory, then maybe this peace was a mistake.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAbusedDiplomaticDemandsUnfallen">We met your demands, yet you declared war. We rail against your deceit, but the Heart still counsels peace. If we must wage war, let us make it brief. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarCordialIdleUnfallen">The Heart rejoices at our peaceful entwining, but the song is tempered by the knowledge this peace was forced upon us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarAfraidUnfallen">With the roots of our empires entwined in peace, we pray for a more harmonious relationship. One based on respect not fear.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarHostileWaryUnfallen">The Unfallen will never turn from the branch of peace, imposed or no, but the Heart counsels caution. We watch you closely.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPeaceUnwillingToUnsureUnfallen">The Unfallen take great strength from our abiding peace. We confess to having doubts, but you have kept your word. Stay true.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceUnfallen">The Heart is always most pained when a peaceful ally betrays those intentions. Peace is a mighty word, but words are only wind. Deeds matter. Soon the Unfallen will break this false peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRequiredShowOfGoodFaithUnfallen">Do you desire peace, truly? The Heart demands a gesture of good faith: a gift of Dust. Rest assured it will be used for peaceful endeavors. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFaithReceivedUnfallen">The Heart is blessed. We thank you for your gift. May this peace flourish.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoshowOfGoodFaithReceivedUnfallen">The absence of a gift saddens the Heart. The path to galactic peace is long and shadowed; our peace will soon splinter.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceWarIntentionUnfallen">Peace must always be chosen freely. Forcing it upon us was your mistake. Prepare yourself for war. The Heart has spoken.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNegotiationRefusedUnfallen">The Heart sees no interest in your words, and little warmth in your heart. We have nothing to say to you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGreetingsTerrans">The Empire welcomes all who embrace its ideals.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarSenderSignedTerransWinning">After your humiliation at the hands of our brave armies, you should be thankful we offer a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarReceiverSignedTerransWinning">A wise choice. The courageous armies of the Empire were ready to smash your pitiful forces.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarSenderSignedTerransLosing">I am a prideful man, but not so proud to be able to admit defeat. The Empire seeks a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarReceiverSignedTerransLosing">The Empire is a slumbering giant. You are sensible to desire a truce while you appear to be winning.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceSenderSignedTerrans">All my Dukes agree with me. The Empire cannot tolerate an illusion of peace, while you agitate for war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceReceiverSignedTerrans">The Empire long remembers other nations' slights against its character. This is a dark day. For your people.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceSenderSignedTerrans">I take this written Alliance, rip it up with my bare hands, and spit on the pieces! The Empire readies itself for the slightest provocation for war!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceReceiverSignedTerrans">Be very clear, this action will not be forgotten. One day your empire will lay begging at the Empire's feet, and it will take all our restraint not to crush you under our heel.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceSenderSignedTerrans">The Empire hoped to teach you peacefully, but I see that my Sheredyn generals were right. I Maximilian Zelevas, First of the Patriots, Bearer of the Iron Hammer, Supreme Authority of the United Empire, declare war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceReceiverSignedTerrans">Ha! You dare to declare war on the mighty United Empire? Pure of heart and mind, soon my brave patriots will drive your fleets against the hard rocks of bitter defeat.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarSenderSignedTerrans">Long have I dreamed of this day when the Empire will send its forces to crush your craven and immoral ideologies. We are at war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedTerrans">Foolish. I, Maximilian Zelevas, Supreme Authority of the United Empire, have raised million-strong armies, smote all my enemies, and united worlds. Why do you think you will be any different?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceSenderSignedTerrans">I. Don't. Like. You.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceReceiverSignedTerrans">You play a dangerous game. The clang of hammers in my shipyards, the march of my armies' boots, and the sounds of your people's screams--all this will be music to my ears soon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceSenderSignedTerrans">Come, don't be so shocked. We play the game of realpolitik, no? You've known all along this alliance could never truly last.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceReceiverSignedTerrans">You make creditable opposition, attacking in the midst of an alliance. We would do the same. Do not expect this declaration of war to end well for you, though.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandFromTruceReceiverSignedTerrans">War . . . War never changes. Do you think someday there might be a generation who can forge a lasting, eternal peace?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarSenderProposedTerrans">The Empire admires your leadership, and the course you chart for your people. We propose a peace treaty for our mutual benefit.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverSignedTerrans">The Empire welcomes the offer of peace from a nation of like-minded patriots.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverRefusedTerrans">This Empire is built on the principles of order, respect, and discipline. We cannot be at peace with you and your rabble.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarSenderProposedTerrans">Stand proudly! Let us forge an alliance that will be the envy of the galaxy! What do you say?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverSignedTerrans">The Empire doesn't enter into alliances lightly. Don't make me regret this decision.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverRefusedTerrans">The Empire refuses. End of story.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceSenderProposedTerrans">All the Empire's Republics agree. Your people make fine patriots. Let us deepen this peace and forge an alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverSignedTerrans">With your courage and our steel, we will forge a mighty alliance. I will appoint a fine Sheredyn to head up the transition team.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverRefusedTerrans">The Empire will not ally with the likes of you. Be thankful we remain at peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSenderProposedTerrans">Is there no finer smell than the sweat on a man's clothes after a hard day's labor? Come, sign this deal while my spirits are so high.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverSignedTerrans">A fine vintage to toast a fine deal, I think! The Empire accepts your proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverRefusedTerrans">No, this won't do at all. With this proposal you spit in the Empire's eye.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverIgnoredTerrans">You are worse than my damn sister! Stop bothering me with things of no consequence.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSignedTerrans">The Empire will always come first. This is how it is.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledgedTerrans">A most . . . interesting choice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentSignedTerrans">The Empire salutes fellow patriots. Exaltations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentAcknowledgedTerrans">Keep your actions as honeyed as your words and we will have no problems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultSignedTerrans">There is more worth in the most diseased rat from the lowliest slum of Raia, than the entire sum of your empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultAcknowledgedTerrans">Know that this slander will be repaid in full. And not with mere words.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandSenderProposedTerrans">I recommend that you agree to the Empire's demands.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandReceiverSignedTerrans">You make demands of the Empire? You know who makes demands? The weak. The strong simply take.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandSenderSignedTerrans">Who are you to make demands of the Empire? This insolence will be met with violence, so you might think twice next time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandReceiverSignedTerrans">As you wish. You will find the Empire's fleets strike as hard my words.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedTerransPrepareWar">The Empire is a civilization forged in the crucible of battle. If you think your declaration of war frightens us, you are very much mistaken.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceWarToWarAcknowledgedTerrans">War. Truce. War. Truce. The Empire is happy you show your true colors.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementSenderProposedTerrans">The sound of industry echoes through the Empire. We have much to trade.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverSignedTerrans">This trade deal will be a boon to both our empires. We accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverRefusedTerrans">You want to trade worthless things, while the Empire offers riches. There is no deal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverSignedTerrans">Science will be the fuel that powers the Empire. We accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverRefusedTerrans">Go offer your primitive science to the Kalgeros. They might find some use for it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersReceiverSignedTerrans">Closed borders? The Empire is never disappointed to close its borders. We accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverSignedTerrans">The Empire agrees to open borders, but be sure not to pry where you are not welcome.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverRefusedTerrans">The Empire has internal affairs to attend. We refuse the offer of open borders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersSenderSignedTerrans">It is time for the Empire to put its house in order, educate a few errant Dukes. We close our borders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersSenderProposedTerrans">Open borders will allow our empires to thrive. I have your agreement, no?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIgnoredTerrans">The Empire has nothing to say at this time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfReceiverSignedTerrans">You have done well to remain hidden from the Empire for so long. Now, though, is the time for us to forge great feats together.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfSenderSignedTerrans">We are the United Empire, and we come to tame the stars. Do not stand in our way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverSignedTerrans">The Empire spans many systems, composes many patriots. We are happy to share maps, but do not make designs on our territory. That will end badly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverSignedTerrans">It is always good to know the movements of less patriotic peoples. They can become . . . problematic if not carefully watched.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingReceiverSignedTerrans">You have slighted the Empire. We hope, for your sake, that you didn't take this decision lightly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementReceiverSignedTerrans">It is no matter. The Empire will find more loyal trading partners.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementReceiverSignedTerrans">The Empire's science base is second to none. You are foolish to walk away from this agreement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverSignedTerrans">Yes, enough blood has been spilled in this bloated war. I will sign the truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationSenderProposedTerrans">This war only weakens both our empires--to others' advantage. We offer a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverRefusedTerrans">A truce? No, I, Emperor Zelevas cannot be seen to be weak. I am the first of the patriots. Tear up your truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverRefusedTerrans">The Empire's stellar cartographers are second-to-none. I would not insult their work, by taking your no doubt slapdash maps. The answer is no.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverRefusedTerrans">Ah, to see what you see would be tempting, but the insight you would have into my own fleets' movements makes this proposition untenable. The Empire declines this offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralPotentialTradingPartnerTerrans">The Empire is an industrial powerhouse. It would be a shrewd move to become our trading partners.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralPotentialFriendTerrans">The Empire feels that our interests are mutually aligned. We could forge a strong friendship, and build a great future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFirstImpressionTerrans">The Empire admires your gift. Such leadership is to be applauded.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementSameAlignementTerrans">Bravo! We find ourselves possessing a similar outlook on many of the galaxy’s other races. Perhaps we share other tastes . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGreatDeedsTerrans">As my Counts and Dukes will tell you, words of praise rarely leave my lips, but your recent deeds have earned my grudging approval. Here's to you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAskTributeTerrans">You are in debt. To us. Pay up or face severe consequences.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouHurtMeTerrans">Foolish. Very foolish. When you cross the Empire you should be sure to eliminate any possibility of retaliation. Our vengeance will be severe.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouWereCruelToMeTerrans">Some say the measure of a civilization is the way it treats its most vulnerable. When the Empire has swept up your people, you will see that we can be merciless.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationGetOutAfterTrespassTerrans">You tread on very thin ice. Withdraw your fleets from Empire territory immediately. Failure to comply will result in severe consequences.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterTrespassingTerrans">To see a creature flayed alive, to see the icy fear in its eyes as it understands the exquisite pain it will soon feel--that is true power. Get your fleets out of Empire territory, or you will be that creature.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterColonizationTerrans">Perhaps I have not made myself clear. The Empire is building a great future among the stars. Settle another system in the path of our expansion and your empire will suffer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionTerrans">Haha! The Empire has great plans for that system. Soon we will found our own outpost, and the race will be on!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoColonizationProblemTerrans">The Empire examined that system and deemed it . . . inadequate. You are quite welcome to it. Good luck.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassMilitaryTerrans">This act of military trespass will not go unpunished. Where, when, and how we will retaliate will be for us to know and you to find out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationRevengeTerrans">Once one of my personal guards thought he could steal from the Emperor. I cut off his right hand, threw it to my dogs. Today he is my most loyal guard. Your empire will suffer a similar fate.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarOpportunistTerrans">The strong dispose of the weak. It has always been thus, and it will always be thus.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementProposePeaceTerrans">Come, let two glorious empires sign a pledge of peace!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDeceiverTerrans">So, you play the friend, but underneath lurks the snake. We will not forget this lesson.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockingExpansionTerrans">The Empire has a great future. Vast fleets, glittering worlds, a thousand billion patriots across the stars. And our path to this future? Blocked by your careless wanderings. So move.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSneakyDemandTerrans">Give me, give me, give me . . . before I united the Empire a rival Duke was always making deceitful demands. When I became Emperor I had him hung in front of the Imperial Palace. Be warned.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralOpenBordersAcceptedTerrans">The opening of your borders is a generous act. We will be respectful when we visit.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementTributeReceivedTerrans">The Imperial coffers welcome your generous donation. It will not be forgotten.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForExpansionTerrans">The time for diplomacy is over. We cannot tolerate such aggressive expansion into Empire space. Prepare to be crushed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersForProtectionTerrans">My scouts tell me that you agitate for war. For this reason, we intend to close our borders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoAttacksSufferedTerrans">Your peaceful approach to the Empire has not gone unnoticed. I have ordered that you be awarded the Purple Falcon for services to the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDemandAcceptedTerrans">You are wise to accept our demands. I am not a man who responds well to refusals.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPositiveContractTerrans">A favorable contract. Well played. The Empire always looks out for those races that understand they shouldn't test our patience.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoHostileActionsTerrans">Perhaps you are playing the long game, but at this moment I commend your hospitable actions. I will send a bottle of my finest palinka.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementUltimatumFulfilledTerrans">The Empire is happy that you can obey instructions. Make sure I don't need to make any ultimatums again.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAttackedUnitsTerrans">You have failed to obey a simple ultimatum. Worse, you attack innocent Empire forces. Our retaliation will be swift and terrible.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumDisregardedTerrans">Your actions bring your empire perilously close to ruin. I would be very wary of my next move, if I were you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightTerrans">You have greatly misunderstood the patriotic fervor of this great Empire if you think another nearby colonization will not go unpunished. Prepare for war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassingTerrans">You are a brave soul to trespass in Empire space so flagrantly. Brave and foolhardy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationColonizationTerrans">Be warned--don't be surprised when we pay your latest system a visit. After all, it is on our doorstep. It won't be a neighborly visit, though.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersTerrans">The Empire turns inwards to address home matters. Please leave our territories.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightNoClosedBordersTerrans">I have grown tired of your provocations, the sightings of your bristling vessels close to Empire population centers. Desist. Now.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAttackedUnitsTerrans">An attack on any Empire citizen or unit is an attack on the entire Empire. I recommend strengthening your defenses.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoBribeParagonTerrans">Your bribe is an insult. For your benefit, I will pretend this never happened. Next time might be different.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarLongPeaceBetrayedTerrans">The Sheredyn hawks counseled that you could not be trusted to keep this peace. They were right. Now you will feel the Empire's vengeance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutScienceAgreementTerrans">Our Mezari traditions ensure the Empire's sciences are strong. If yours are likewise, it may be time to sign a science agreement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutTradeAgreementTerrans">Expansion and exploitation never come cheap. Perhaps we should sign a trade agreement soon to fuel our empires?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralMercantileThinkingAboutTradeAgreementTerrans">The Empire is used to building and fighting. Trading with others is not in our blood, yet it could benefit us. A proposal will come when the patriots are convinced . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulPeaceAcknowledgementTerrans">It is time you came to the Imperial Palace as an honored friend of the Empire. We will drink brandy, smoke Lumeris cigars, and indulge in other, darker, pleasures.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulTradeAgreementAcknowledgementTerrans">Wealth flows into the Imperial coffers! All patriots rejoice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulScienceAgreementAcknowledgementTerrans">My chief scientist, Petra Mandzukic, informs me that her teams are learning much from your sciences. One day we might make you an honorary patriot!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandTerrans">Let me tell you the thing about demands. Friends don't make them. And if they do, they make sure they can enforce them. Can you?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyTerrans">Tell me, what purpose does it serve to parade your battle fleets through a comrade's territory? Do you want marks out of ten?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedSovereignSpaceTerrans">I think I'm beginning to take a shine to you. No trespassing? No demands? I might not need to attend tonight's executions to stay in a good mood.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationIsolationistPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumTerrans">Tut, tut, tut. You've been caught somewhere you shouldn't have been. Hold out your knuckles. Or whatever you have that passes for knuckles. It's cold war time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyUltimatumTerrans">Hmm, correct me if I'm wrong--though that's rarely the case--but didn't I tell you to remove your military forces from Empire space? No, don't answer. I did. GET THEM THE HELL OUT! NOW!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandAndNoGestureTerrans">Didn't I already tell you about demands? Show some respect. Make a gesture.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumTerrans">The Empire doesn't speak with traitors. Yes, I'm talking about your fleets' persistent trespass. Diplomatic privileges will be withdrawn shortly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedNoTrespassTerrans">You've removed your trespassing battle fleets? Good. Better. I hope I don't have to ask again.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeNoGestureTerrans">No gesture, then? Have it your way. Our peace accords will be ripped up shortly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerMadeGestureTerrans">Some say it's the thought that counts. That's weakness talking. Like your gesture. But anything is better than nothing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingSenderSignedTerrans">Let us share our vision! Not of the future, but of our ships and systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingSenderSignedTerrans">You see too much, and reveal too little. We do not trust you, and cancel our shared vision agreement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingSenderProposedTerrans">A galaxy this vast requires many eyes to fathom its secrets. The Empire proposes that we share maps.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementSenderProposedTerrans">The Mezari scientists of the Empire are famed; perhaps you would like to share in our knowledge.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedHelpTerrans">Will you come to aid us in our time of need? Are you a patriot? The Empire considers offering an alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedCounterOtherAllianceTerrans">Look how the other half of the galaxy conspires together. Isn't it time we forged an alliance? We will make a proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedHelpTerrans">Our peace means a lot to the Empire. We come to think of you as fellow patriots, helping to make the galaxy great again. You would fight alongside us, no, if we offered an alliance?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedCounterOtherAllianceTerrans">Is it not time to forge a deeper bond between our great nations to counter other axes forming across the galaxy? Our peace should beget an alliance. Be ready for a proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceAgainstCommonEnemyTerrans">I see we share a common enemy. Wouldn't it make sense for us to cement this peace with an alliance so we might smite our foe together?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForGoodRelationsTerrans">We should drink to our peace! One shot for every year! Listen, friend, soon the Empire will propose an alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForVictoryTerrans">We walk a common path--one of righteousness and valor. Wouldn't it be wise to find victory together as an alliance? We will send a proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNeedMilitaryHelpTerrans">It is a dark time for the Empire. It is time the Empire called upon its allies' aid. We are expecting you . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralHelpingAllyTerrans">The Empire sees that you need help. Don't worry, we will come.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGiftTerrans">A gift for our great allies--and a reminder of your allegiances.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGoodGiftTerrans">The Empire does not give such gifts to any ally. Know what this means to us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandNoGiftReceivedTerrans">I think I might be repeating myself, but I will say it anyway. Demands should only be made by those who can enforce them. This alliance will soon be over.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandTerrans">You know, you look very ugly when you make demands. Perhaps it is the distaste you feel when making demands of an ALLY!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementVeryPositiveGiftTerrans">Your gift warms the heart of every patriot across our mighty Empire. I offer you a full pardon for your previous actions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralWeakGiftTerrans">A gift? This is more like something my dogs might drag from the canals.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoHelpThenNoGiftReceivedTerrans">Call yourself an ally? You've proved yourself as useful as my third-born. And equally unexpendable. The Empire tolerates our alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementReceivedHelpLateTerrans">Ah, now you offer your ally assistance. Well done, you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoHelpReceivedTerrans">Your disdain for our alliance has been made quite clear.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemNoGiftTerrans">Whether through force or assimilation, the Empire takes the theft of its systems very seriously. Without recompense for this loss, we move to end this alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemMultipleTerrans">Allies do not take from each other, peacefully or not. I know full well what to do with an ally such as yourself; uniting the Empire taught me that. This alliance will be ended soon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAwokeGuardianTerrans">Haha! A mighty patriot to inspire the Empire! We will drink to this Guardian!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRootedMySystemTerrans">As long as these tendrils remain benign, I welcome their presence in Empire space. Faster travel is a great boon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarAmAlreadyAtWarTerrans">A treacherous act, but not one that unsettles the Empire. I have fought wars on multiple fronts before, and I will do it again. Your time in our crosshairs will come.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarNoRoomToExpandTerrans">The path to the Empire's victory sometimes skirts others' lands and sometimes tramples right through them. This time it's the latter. Consider it an honor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPlayerAlreadyAtWarTerrans">The Empire cannot wait for you to resolve your petty squabble elsewhere. We declare war on you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralBlockadedSystemAtWarTerrans">My people suffer! Only a monster would blockade a system during a time of war!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAttackedCiviliansAtWarTerrans">We will etch the names of the dead on memorials up and down the Empire. None will be forgotten in your butchery of innocents.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAwokeGuardianAtWarTerrans">What is this "Guardian" abomination that you raise up from Empire land? You transgress the conventions of war at your peril.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDestroyedMyPlanetAtWarTerrans">Arghhhhhh!!!!! A plague of pestilence and misery on you and all your worlds! For this destruction, I will have you flayed and hung!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleAtPeaceTerrans">I do not know what sorcery this is, but the Empire welcomes the effects of this singularity.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleAtPeaceTerrans">Your temporal witchcraft is unappreciated. What are you up to?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemUltimatumTerrans">A strong Empire should conquer--not make gains through the duplicitous act of cultural assimilation. Convert another of our systems at your peril.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDisregardedConversionUltimatumTerrans">Am I speaking to an imbecile? Do not convert Empire systems, I said! This peace will soon be over.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRespectedConversionUltimatumTerrans">You are wise to refrain from any further peaceful assimilations of the Empire's systems. Carry on like this and we have a future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleTerrans">You call this a singularity, eh? I am not sure I like the means, but the ends are well received.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleTerrans">My distrust of this time-mangling sorcery seems well founded. Stay on this path at your own risk.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockadedMySystemTerrans">This restriction on Empire movement is unacceptable! Think very carefully about continuing this blockade.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedMyPlanetTerrans">The Empire will never forget this colossal atrocity.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementOutpostCompetitionWonTerrans">With the fire of the patriotic in our hearts, the Empire was always going to win that race.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionLostTerrans">You won the outpost race. A lack of steel accounts for this humiliation, and those responsible will be punished. Do not expect us to repeat this mistake.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoTributeReceivedTerrans">Where is our tribute? You refuse to pay? An interesting--and dangerous--choice. So be it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredOfBorderUnitsTerrans">The Empire notes the build up of your fleets on our borders. What are you thinking?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredAfterAttacksTerrans">Only a tyrant kicks a wounded animal. Help us heal and we can stand together.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationClosedBordersScaredTerrans">The Empire has internal affairs to attend. Do not take offense at the closure of our borders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingHarassWarTerrans">The United Empire will defend its interests with all the tools at its disposal, diplomatic or otherwise. As such, I have authorized limited hostilities against your empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingConquestWarTerrans">You stand in the Empire's way. Prepare to be conquered.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedAPlanetTerrans">Ah, what a mighty weapon you wield, destroying a world on a whim. Rest assured, you will pay a heavy price for this despicable act.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAfraidDestroyedAPlanetTerrans">Bravo, bravo! I like statements of intent, and obliterating an entire world doesn't get any clearer. We're not in your sights next, are we?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPeaceDestroyedAPlanetTerrans">Some have called me a madman, but I would be reluctant to destroy entire worlds as you have. Our peace is under threat if you continue such insanities.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAbusedDiplomaticDemandsTerrans">You made demands. We met those demands. Yet now you declare war. You are beneath even roaches. I spit on you, and your rotten empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarCordialIdleTerrans">Was my door ever not open to you? Why force this peace when asking would've achieved the same result—and kept my respect?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarAfraidTerrans">Well judged, ally. It is wise to make peace with those who fear you as they may act rashly and cause you great pain.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarHostileWaryTerrans">So, you impose peace? Do I look like a man who should be trifled with? No, I do not. You will do well to remember that when you consider your next move.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPeaceUnwillingToUnsureTerrans">The peace abides! Forgive the Empire our earlier cynicism; if our positions had been reversed you would've doubted the sincerity of this imposed peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceTerrans">You imposed peace for what?! This mockery of diplomacy is of no interest to the Empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRequiredShowOfGoodFaithTerrans">This peace has a price. A price that hasn't been paid yet. The Empire expects a gift--of Dust.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFaithReceivedTerrans">Good. This is good. Your gift means that we have an understanding. I can see this being a lasting peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoshowOfGoodFaithReceivedTerrans">So no gift. I think, when you contemplate your actions, you will regret ever having forced peace upon us. The Empire remembers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceWarIntentionTerrans">This peace? This peace will not save you. Soon the hammer of the Empire will fall on your fleets and lands.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNegotiationRefusedTerrans">The Empire saves its counsel for itself. We tire of the whining of your diplomats.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGreetingsHoratio">Be content! Fortune smiles, for Horatio is willing to speak with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarSenderSignedHoratioWinning">Now that you understand our flawless superiority, you may wish to sign a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarReceiverSignedHoratioWinning">Fortunately your wisdom exceeds your oversized ego. You are wise to submit to our truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarSenderSignedHoratioLosing">Luck appears to be on your side. We are forced to consider a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarReceiverSignedHoratioLosing">You are wise to accept a truce, as our genetic superiority would eventually mean your end.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceSenderSignedHoratio">We cannot accept a continued status of peace when you insist on ignoring our obvious wisdom. Alas for your offspring, it is war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceReceiverSignedHoratio">Your manners (and your looks) drive us to move our nations from peace to a state of cold war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceSenderSignedHoratio">Enough of your uncultured, knuckle-dragging ignorance! We end this alliance and give you the cold shoulder of cold war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceReceiverSignedHoratio">We offer you a place at our side, and you turn from alliance to cold war? Clearly we overestimated your intelligence.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceSenderSignedHoratio">This truce is as tepid as your personality. Horatio, on behalf of all Horatio, declares war!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceReceiverSignedHoratio">You declare war upon all Horatio? I see. Were we as ugly as you, we too might consider suicide.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarSenderSignedHoratio">The chill displeases us; Horatio goes from cold war to the very hottest war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedHoratio">I have spread glory and beauty across systems. Your ugly declaration of war will not stop the inevitable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceSenderSignedHoratio">Your peace--and your conversation--is so nightmarishly dull that we have no choice but to declare war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceReceiverSignedHoratio">You wish to move from peace to war? If our music was as atonal as yours, we too might prefer the screams of our wounded.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceSenderSignedHoratio">Other than Horatio beauty, nothing really lasts. You can keep this alliance as a fond memory of our perfection until our war lays you low.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceReceiverSignedHoratio">From alliance to war? Your skills at diplomacy are as hideous as your taste in garments. We gladly accept, in the name of galactic culture.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandFromTruceReceiverSignedHoratio">You insist on war?! Just when the spring collection was coming out. For that alone, we are glad to end this truce!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarSenderProposedHoratio">Please don't take this the wrong way, but we would prefer to share the warmth of peace with you rather than the chill of cold war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverSignedHoratio">Horatio are always content to be at peace; even the mild stress of cold war does terrible things to one's complexion.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverRefusedHoratio">At peace? With you? Next you'll be proposing sharing a sauna and I'm not sure our hearts are strong enough. Cold war suits me just fine.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarSenderProposedHoratio">Cold war is such an aimless, indifferent thing. Let us forge an alliance of like-minded, if not equally attractive, partners.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverSignedHoratio">From cold war you propose an alliance? I'm not sure if I should be excited or terrified, but the idea intrigues me.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverRefusedHoratio">No, no no. From cold war to alliance? Just like that? If you misread signals that badly I wouldn't even go to a nightclub with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceSenderProposedHoratio">We think of you as a hopeful, if occasionally wearying, work in progress. Shall we strengthen our relations from peace to alliance in the hopes that your cultural evolution continues?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverSignedHoratio">It would please Horatio to join an alliance with you. Be honored; in this pedestrian universe few things please us at all.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverRefusedHoratio">No. Thank you. Peace is sufficient; we prefer to stay far enough away to keep ourselves upwind.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSenderProposedHoratio">It is the opportunity of your lifetime! Our beauty and genius allied with your, ah, more prosaic attributes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverSignedHoratio">It is a pleasure to close this negotiation on a positive note. Let us celebrate! Ah, separately…</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverRefusedHoratio">Horatio would be the laughing stock of Horatio! I'll make it simple for you: No.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverIgnoredHoratio">The number of more important things I have to do is beyond your math skills. Just go away.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSignedHoratio">Horatio insists. And Horatio, if gorgeous, is very stubborn.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledgedHoratio">I see. Next you'll be imposing your "culture", won't you? We hope not.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentSignedHoratio">You may not see this as a compliment but it is: You have the most lovely DNA.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentAcknowledgedHoratio">Why thank you. It is refreshing to see another being with a touch of good taste in this grim galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultSignedHoratio">We considered insulting you, but doubted that you would understand as we occasionally use words of more than one syllable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultAcknowledgedHoratio">We could never forget this! Because we haven't laughed so hard in ages.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandSenderProposedHoratio">A hint: If you wish to be seen as being as wise as Horatio, you will agree to acquiesce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandReceiverSignedHoratio">You accuse us of putting "pressure" on you? Perhaps if you were wiser and less ugly it wouldn't be an issue.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandSenderSignedHoratio">After careful analysis, Horatio has decided that the galactic gene pool will be much healthier without you in it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandReceiverSignedHoratio">Unilaterally declaring war is your idea of a smart thing to do? We look forward to removing your DNA from the galactic gene pool.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedHoratioPrepareWar">We are an endless supply of gorgeous, fit and talented geniuses. Prepare to be darwinned.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceWarToWarAcknowledgedHoratio">I've had fashion consultants who were more predictable than you. If you do indeed have a mind, please make it up.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementSenderProposedHoratio">With our clever minds and refined tastes we have much to trade with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverSignedHoratio">We look forward to becoming mutually indolent.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverRefusedHoratio">We would be happy to trade, if you had anything worthwhile. Sadly, we must say "No".</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementSenderProposedHoratio">A glimpse into our genius must necessarily be of interest to you. Shall we share sciences?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverSignedHoratio">The thought of combining our intelligence makes us weak. We agree!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverRefusedHoratio">As soon as you manage to develop sciences worth knowing, we would be glad to share them. But not now.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersReceiverSignedHoratio">You were beginning to annoy us anyway. We are happy to close borders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverSignedHoratio">Open borders? Why not! Just mind the furniture and try to be discreet, yes?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverRefusedHoratio">We don't think we could survive an onslaught of your uncouth hordes. We prefer to keep our borders closed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersSenderSignedHoratio">We have had enough mingling with lesser peoples and their unpleasant ways. We are closing our borders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersSenderProposedHoratio">Let us open borders! We can share knowledge, art, and culture while we both get rich. A typically brilliant Horatio idea.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIgnoredHoratio">We have so many things that are more interesting to do. We are ignoring you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfReceiverSignedHoratio">We are known as Horatio. I am known as Horatio. Feel free to look upon us in envy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfSenderSignedHoratio">Greetings from Horatio, the First, the Most Gorgeous.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverSignedHoratio">One day every planet will be as beautiful as Horatio Prime--but first we must learn the location of these worlds! Let us share maps.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverSignedHoratio">It can be painful to watch less beautiful things, but sometimes it is necessary. We agree to share what we know.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingReceiverSignedHoratio">Do you not trust the finest eyes in the galaxy? Horatio's eyes? Your world is about to become a lot darker.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementReceiverSignedHoratio">Horatio produces some of the finest goods in the galaxy. Maybe too good for the likes of you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementReceiverSignedHoratio">You see this cranium? This cranium--and many like it--has produced some of the finest science ever to grace the galaxy. And you want to step away from these insights. Your loss!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverSignedHoratio">Horatio must admit that this war hasn't been the beautification project he'd envisaged. Horatio accepts a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationSenderProposedHoratio">Horatio thinks you've been taught your lesson, and is magnanimous enough to offer a truce. What do you say?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverRefusedHoratio">Why would Horatio accept a truce when Horatio's fleets are doing such sterling work laying the groundwork for galactic beautification?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverRefusedHoratio">Horatio's maps are things of exquisite beauty, ill fit for your tawdry empire. We will not be sharing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverRefusedHoratio">You think that I, Horatio, can stand to see the galaxy from your ragtag fleets' and gaudy systems' points of view? It would be too painful. So no.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralPotentialTradingPartnerHoratio">Perhaps we might trade; your more useful trinkets for some of the gorgeous products of Horatio genius.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralPotentialFriendHoratio">Horatio are prepared to honor you with our friendship.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFirstImpressionHoratio">Horatio appreciate your willingness to seek our good favor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementSameAlignementHoratio">It is not a secret that Horatio share your opinion of those repulsive fools.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGreatDeedsHoratio">Horatio laud your excellent handling of that pathetic nation of arrogant barbarians.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAskTributeHoratio">It is no easy task to beautify an entire galaxy, and Horatio must ask that you contribute a bit of Dust to the effort.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouHurtMeHoratio">Do not impose such pain and displeasure on Horatio! Or be prepared to bear the consequences.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouWereCruelToMeHoratio">Acts of savagery upon the beauty of Horatio do not go unnoticed, and they may be avenged.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationGetOutAfterTrespassHoratio">You are not up to our standards of personal hygiene; please leave Horatio territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterTrespassingHoratio">Your ships fly in Horatio space; for reasons of security and beauty we want them out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterColonizationHoratio">You interrupt our glorious plans for a more beautiful galaxy with your lumpish and malodorous colony.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionHoratio">Horatio's drive to beautify is an evolutionary imperative; do not be surprised if you soon see colonies that embody this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoColonizationProblemHoratio">Before the galaxy can be beautified it must be pacified, so we understand your recent colonization efforts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassMilitaryHoratio">It does not please us to see your military ships in our skies. Remove them or they will be purged in the name of beauty.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationRevengeHoratio">Horatio do not forget insults and ills done to us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarOpportunistHoratio">Horatio note an opportunity to improve and tidy a bit of the galaxy; we apologize that to do so we must remove your vessels.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementProposePeaceHoratio">Horatio graciously extend the branch of peace in spite of our obvious moral and intellectual superiority.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDeceiverHoratio">Sadly, our ideal of a pure and perfect galaxy cannot go far while untrustworthy deceivers like you inhabit it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockingExpansionHoratio">The galaxy desperately needs Horatio to beautify it, yet you purposefully block our path to doing so.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSneakyDemandHoratio">Though Horatio is always brilliant and glorious, we see that you will stoop to unworthy actions. You are no friend of Horatio.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralOpenBordersAcceptedHoratio">Horatio are always content to see open borders; you must also be looking forward to the beauty of an increased Horatio presence.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementTributeReceivedHoratio">Horatio are moved by your willingness to contribute to our great project of Horatiofication.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForExpansionHoratio">We fully intend to make the galaxy more beautiful. Perhaps you now understand why we go to war with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersForProtectionHoratio">Horatio desires to close our borders; there is too much ugly out there.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoAttacksSufferedHoratio">Horatio are content that there have been no attacks that might interrupt our great projects.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDemandAcceptedHoratio">It is good that other people also see the wisdom in doing what Horatio deem is right.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPositiveContractHoratio">We take this offering as a homage to our perfection.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoHostileActionsHoratio">It is possible that Horatio judged you precipitously; your peaceful demeanor is encouraging.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementUltimatumFulfilledHoratio">Horatio appreciate that you conceded to our exigencies; we hope relations continue to improve.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAttackedUnitsHoratio">Horatio ask that you respect our reasonable demands and you use that as grounds for war? Truly the galaxy is full of madness.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumDisregardedHoratio">You ignore our request to leave our gorgeous empire unsullied? Your ships must leave!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightHoratio">Horatio are angered that you continue to plant your ugly little colonies like pimples on the galaxy. We will cleanse them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassingHoratio">In your arrogance and poor taste you continue to travel and build where you please. We cannot stand so much physical and moral ugliness.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationColonizationHoratio">Your obsession with colonization could be viewed as an act of war, or worse, littering.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersHoratio">For our own serenity and peace of mind we must close our borders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightNoClosedBordersHoratio">Our crusade to make the universe more comely will begin with the destruction of the military fleets you persistently place in our territory--unless you stop.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAttackedUnitsHoratio">Though we did not count you among our admirers, was it really necessary to destroy our gorgeous ships?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoBribeParagonHoratio">We try to be as morally perfect as we are physically ideal. We do not accept this sort of payment.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarLongPeaceBetrayedHoratio">You declare war on Horatio after bearing such close witness to Horatio's perfection? Unforgivable!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutScienceAgreementHoratio">I imagine Horatio science will be difficult for you to comprehend such is its majesty. But one must educate one's fellow races. A science agreement will be sent soon!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutTradeAgreementHoratio">As you look on Horatio's beauty with envy, so Horatio looks upon your Dust reserves. A trade agreement could be lucrative--for both parties.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralMercantileThinkingAboutTradeAgreementHoratio">Lesser Horatios--Horatios that are shadows of I, Horatio Prime--inform me that we should trade. Therefore, we are putting together a proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulPeaceAcknowledgementHoratio">Given our fabulous spell of peace, Horatio considers you his best friend. Like a dog.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulTradeAgreementAcknowledgementHoratio">Horatio have had their eyes opened by some of the strange goods that your empire have traded with us. The galaxy truly is a wondrous place--in need of Horatiofication.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulScienceAgreementAcknowledgementHoratio">Genetics, cloning, replicating perfection--that's Horatio's bag. It's a marvel that your science can lend itself to other aims. Some that Horatio even find useful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandHoratio">Now look here, pal. Your offending Horatio's feelings with this demand. And Horatio's feelings are some of the finest feelings in the galaxy. They shouldn't have to put up with this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyHoratio">Taking notes on the galaxy's most beautiful fleets, eh? You really didn't need to send military vessels into Horatio space. Horatio are more than happy to send pics.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedSovereignSpaceHoratio">What do you get if you cross two Horatios? The end of the universe because no reality can withstand such perfection. Erm, and thanks--for heeding Horatio's concerns.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationIsolationistPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumHoratio">Horatio were spending some time alone so as not to accidentally gaze on imperfection. And you ruined it with your ugly battle fleets crawling into the Horatiocracy. Expect cold war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyUltimatumHoratio">Horatio have already forcefully asked you to remove your military vessels from Horatio's gorgeous territories, so now we're asking again. Only even more forcefully this time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandAndNoGestureHoratio">I suppose even I would struggle to find a gift for one who has everything. Still, etiquette dictates that demands are accompanied by some form of largesse. A bronze statue of Horatio?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumHoratio">The trespassing wouldn't be so bad if your battle fleets weren't so terrifically ugly. Horatio can only stomach so many incursions!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedNoTrespassHoratio">Finally, untrammeled views of Horatio's perfect territories! So long ugly fleets!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeNoGestureHoratio">A gift! A gift! Not a GIF! And, no, Horatio don't appreciate a three-second loop of Horatio walking into a door. Horatio will petition Horatio for cold war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerMadeGestureHoratio">A meager gesture. But everything is meager next to this specimen of perfection, isn't it? Oh well, thanks, I suppose.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingSenderSignedHoratio">Though your eyes may not be as beautiful as Horatio's, we can at least propose that they see the same things.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingSenderSignedHoratio">This agreement no longer suits us; Horatio will keep for our self what our gorgeous eyes see.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingSenderProposedHoratio">Though you cannot share the spirit and brilliance of Horatio, you can see what we have seen.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedHelpHoratio">Horatio are considering offering you the honor of an alliance, so you might fight alongside such a beautiful specimen. How is your nail-care routine?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedCounterOtherAllianceHoratio">Our relations might be cold, but some seriously ugly specimens are getting together. Despite your own imperfections Horatio is considering an alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedHelpHoratio">Horatio's quest to beautify the galaxy could be speeded up with your help. What would you say if we offered an alliance?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedCounterOtherAllianceHoratio">Horatio is somewhat surprised at the peace that can exist between the perfect--me--and the imperfect--you--but there it is. Why don’t we consolidate this unequal affair with an alliance to counter other, uglier, unions?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceAgainstCommonEnemyHoratio">Ah, Horatio sees that we share an enemy--a boil on the backside of the galaxy, indeed. Why don't we throw our lot in together and get all hot and sweaty as we lance the boil?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForGoodRelationsHoratio">Horatio is somewhat agog of the resilient peace that has blossomed between our, ahem, diverse empires. Even more shocking is Horatio's intention to propose an alliance shortly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForVictoryHoratio">Horatio sees you follow its magnificent figure on the path to victory. Well, who wouldn't try and emulate perfection? Anyway, Horatio thinks an alliance might save everyone trouble.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNeedMilitaryHelpHoratio">Hey, me old ally . . . erm, what's your name again? Be a good sport and lend Horatio a hand. We're having a little spot of fisticuffs bother.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralHelpingAllyHoratio">Well, well, well, bitten off more than you can chew old chum? Never worry, your capable--and unreasonably handsome--ally is here to help.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGiftHoratio">A gift from Horatio to you. Exquisitely chosen, Horatio thinks you'll agree.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGoodGiftHoratio">In no way are you to see this magnificent gift as a means of Horatio seeking benefit. More like another perfectly ethical political donation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandNoGiftReceivedHoratio">I'm sorry, did the gift to accompany your most rude demand get lost en-route? Horatio will be extricating themselves from this alliance post-haste.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandHoratio">Do you see a sign on my rather large, shiny, and regal forehead proclaiming "Sucker"? No, I don't believe you do. So behave like an ally.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementVeryPositiveGiftHoratio">This gift is rather fine--like Horatio--and makes up for previous disappointments.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralWeakGiftHoratio">Horatio is not satisfied by this paltry gift, and might need to lie down to recover.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoHelpThenNoGiftReceivedHoratio">Maybe Horatio shouldn't judge. You probably thought a being as perfect as Horatio was joking when he asked for help. Horatio wasn’t.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementReceivedHelpLateHoratio">Horatio hasn't experienced such slowness since Horatio tried to explain the genius of its cloning tech to anyone except the Sophons. Next time, come faster!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoHelpReceivedHoratio">Now, I know it's hard to imagine, but Horatio actually seeks help. Please send forthwith.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemNoGiftHoratio">How another culture could be greater than Horatio's is . . . beyond Horatio. But, in any case, your conversion of Horatio's system without redress is most alarming. We seek to withdraw from this alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemMultipleHoratio">Your ability to ignore Horatio's words and continue stealing Horatio's systems--peacefully or not--is most uncivil. We move to dissolve this alliance post-haste.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAwokeGuardianHoratio">Of course, to compare this newly awoken "Guardian" to Horatio would not be fair, but it does have a certain charm.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRootedMySystemHoratio">Anything that can help Horatio beautify the galaxy more rapidly is always welcome. Hmm, these tendrils are fascinating . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarAmAlreadyAtWarHoratio">So, you don't like Horatio either? Envy is such a ugly emotion, isn't it? Horatio will deal with you later.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarNoRoomToExpandHoratio">It is such a drag to be pinned into a corner of the galaxy. Fortunately your grubby little empire offers Horatio a path to greater things. Prepare to gape open-mouthed at Horatio's beautiful battle fleets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPlayerAlreadyAtWarHoratio">Distracted elsewhere? Wonderful. A prime time for Horatio to make our move. Don't pay us too much attention as you'll want to conclude your other war first.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralBlockadedSystemAtWarHoratio">Think of all the Horatios you deny freedom of movement with your blockade! Why should the galaxy suffer our absence for your petty reasons?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAttackedCiviliansAtWarHoratio">An attack on civilians is despicable. An attack on Horatio civilians is despicable and a crime against beauty.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAwokeGuardianAtWarHoratio">This "Guardian" you have invoked on our world does not meet Horatio's standards of splendor. Please remove it straightaway.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDestroyedMyPlanetAtWarHoratio">The galaxy is greatly diminished this day. Your callous destruction of our world will pain all Horatio hearts forever.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleAtPeaceHoratio">For Horatio to be preserved beyond time's cruel reach would be the pinnacle of perfection. This singularity brings Horatio closer to that ideal. Well done.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleAtPeaceHoratio">No, no, no! Horatio is a fine wine that needs to be savored by the galaxy. This horrible singularity threatens our galactic beautification!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemUltimatumHoratio">We may be at peace, but don't mistake that for an endorsement of your culture. It is--and always will be--a shadow of Horatio's. Convert another system of the great Horatiocracy at your peril.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDisregardedConversionUltimatumHoratio">It greatly pains Horatio to know that some of his imperfect incarnations now wander the barren landscape of your culture. What suffering they must feel! Horatio warned you not to culturally convert again, so now we move to end this peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRespectedConversionUltimatumHoratio">Well played, well played. You obviously recognize the superiority of Horatio culture compared to your own. Now the next step is let Horatio convert your systems . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleHoratio">This singularity is an appropriate gift for a lesser empire to give a greater one. Carry on.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleHoratio">Well, buff my forehead with Dust, this deleterious singularity is beyond galactic norms of behavior! Cut it out!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockadedMySystemHoratio">Horatio is like the most marvelous young bird that needs to spread its wings and show its beauty to all. Your blockade is not appreciated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedMyPlanetHoratio">(under breath) Permission for lip to wobble, Horatio. Permission denied. Don't give them the satisfaction.
Ahem, Horatio didn't care about that world anyway. Slackers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementOutpostCompetitionWonHoratio">Of course you're going to lose against a side that has brains, beauty, and a domed forehead that can be seen from space. The system is Horatio's!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionLostHoratio">Huh? I blame my Z'vali underlings. Too much time in the virtual instead of the real world! Obviously the loss of this outpost can't be Horatio's fault . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoTributeReceivedHoratio">Horatio to Empty-Head! Aren't you forgetting something? The little matter of Horatio's tribute. Do we need to ask again?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredOfBorderUnitsHoratio">A nagging question: Those fleets amassing on Horatio's borders--they wouldn't be planning anything ugly, would they? Show some taste and keep them over there, yes?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredAfterAttacksHoratio">I think there may have been a little misunderstanding here. It is Horatio's destiny to beautify the galaxy; your dastardly attacks are creating cracks in the mirror. You'll stop, won't you? Won't you? Please stop!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationClosedBordersScaredHoratio">From time to time it is necessary for Horatio to insulate itself from the body galactic--and all its imperfect specimens. We close our borders to navel gaze. Literally.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingHarassWarHoratio">You are a consistent pest, an annoying insect, a troublesome parasite, and we are about to eliminate you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingConquestWarHoratio">As the galaxy begs to be beautified, your elimination is unfortunate but necessary. Shall we call it "collateral improvement"?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedAPlanetHoratio">If anyone is to obliterate worlds, it is I, Horatio, beautifier of the galaxy! To say we are not pleased is an understatement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAfraidDestroyedAPlanetHoratio">Now, your, erm, galactic re-landscaping program wouldn't be being considered for Horatio's worlds, would it? The galaxy be a much lesser place without me, no?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPeaceDestroyedAPlanetHoratio">Horatio wants to beautify the galaxy, not erase it! In light of further planetary annihiliation we might have to reconsider this peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAbusedDiplomaticDemandsHoratio">War? You declare war on I, Horatio, the most perfect specimen in the galaxy, after Horatio ceded to your ugly demands? You rotter!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarCordialIdleHoratio">For you to force peaceful relations on Horatio was the height of bad manners. But, Horatio, in his everlasting perfection, forgives you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarAfraidHoratio">Even in my fear, I could feel Horatio's brand of fear was a superior one. But peace is welcome too.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarHostileWaryHoratio">So, it is peace, is it? Curious and curiouser. Oh, how you fascinate Horatio with your clumsy realpolitik!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPeaceUnwillingToUnsureHoratio">Bravo, bravo! You have surpassed Horatio's--admittedly low--expectations with the continuance of this imposed peace. Give yourself a satisfied gaze in the mirror. Works wonders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceHoratio">This hollow peace you imposed on us is a stain on your name. Don't feel too bad; it is hard, perhaps impossible, for any race to live up to Horatio's exacting standards.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRequiredShowOfGoodFaithHoratio">You know, a man of Horatio's exquisite refinement has exceedingly expensive taste. If we are to proceed down this path of peace, then a gift of Dust is the least you can do to prove your good intentions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFaithReceivedHoratio">Of course, a man of Horatio's perfection should be lavished with gifts in any case, but this will certainly help cement our peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoshowOfGoodFaithReceivedHoratio">You play a dangerous game. Horatio is not a man--nor an empire--to be trifled with. No gift begets no peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceWarIntentionHoratio">Horatio, in his infinite wisdom, has left the alliance so that his beautiful armies may soon be unleashed on your people. Our peace is over.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNegotiationRefusedHoratio">Horatio finds your entreaties, treaties, and treats all equally annoying. We are not interested in talking to you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGreetingsTimeLords">We are Riftborn. We come into your cosmos on a mission of survival.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarSenderSignedTimeLordsWinning">We gain no satisfaction from diminishing you, and only seek our survival. Sign the truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarReceiverSignedTimeLordsWinning">A logical choice. This war benefits none.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarSenderSignedTimeLordsLosing">Please, as one sentient species to another, agree to a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarReceiverSignedTimeLordsLosing">The Riftborn are thankful. If we survive we will remember this kindness.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceSenderSignedTimeLords">The Riftborn regret that relations must turn from peace to something colder. It is the way it was always destined to be, and it is the way it is.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceReceiverSignedTimeLords">We are not surprised you jettison the peace between our races. It is foretold.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceSenderSignedTimeLords">This alliance is causing us . . . unease. The Riftborn disentangle themselves and return to more comfortable relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceReceiverSignedTimeLords">We always harbored doubts that we could make meaningful relations with the dominant species of this galaxy. So it comes to pass.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceSenderSignedTimeLords">The Communion has sent orders. We are at war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceReceiverSignedTimeLords">War, the bluntest of diplomatic instruments. So be it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarSenderSignedTimeLords">As it was always written. We move from distrust to all out war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedTimeLords">Isn't it a pitiful state of affairs? We came as strangers, seeking only refuge, and yet your response is hate and aggression. Make no mistake, we will defend our interests with extreme prejudice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceSenderSignedTimeLords">The peace between our species doesn't serve the Riftborn's purposes. Be prepared for conflict.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceReceiverSignedTimeLords">Are you sure you know how to fight time-shifting strangers from another dimension? We predict you will regret this choice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceSenderSignedTimeLords">This universe--its planets, its nature, but most of all its reaching, grasping lifeforms--disgusts us. This alliance is suffocating us with your stench. It is over. And we are coming to erase you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceReceiverSignedTimeLords">Whatever it is you think you will find through this act of aggression, you will not.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandFromTruceReceiverSignedTimeLords">We never knew war, back in Coroz. Yet how easily it comes to this universe.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarSenderProposedTimeLords">Understand, it is not easy for us to seek a union of peace in this universe, but that is our desire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverSignedTimeLords">Peace is a natural state for the Riftborn. We welcome this development.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverRefusedTimeLords">At this time, the Riftborn wish not to entangle themselves further with other races. Let's stay . . . isolated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarSenderProposedTimeLords">For us, the future is no less hidden than the past. Everything simply is. But we must perform the dance nonetheless. What do you say to an alliance?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverSignedTimeLords">Intriguing. You seek an alliance with the Riftborn?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverRefusedTimeLords">We are still trying to understand this universe--and its inhabitants. Trust isn't easy. And without trust, an alliance is impossible.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceSenderProposedTimeLords">It is time for this peace to become something more. Will you join us in an alliance?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverSignedTimeLords">The Riftborn believe our goals are aligned. We welcome an alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverRefusedTimeLords">The Communion have instructed me to decline your offer of an alliance. A peaceful co-existence is sufficient.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSenderProposedTimeLords">We have analyzed the situation from many angles, and we believe this proposal will be mutually beneficial.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverSignedTimeLords">I, Grand Viceroy of New Coroz, accept your proposal on behalf of the Communion. That isn't an invitation to invade my personal space though.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverRefusedTimeLords">I picked up a useful expression from the Sophons recently: Go swivel.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverIgnoredTimeLords">We Riftborn think it better not to speak of this so-called deal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSignedTimeLords">This is the way it will be. Nothing can change that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledgedTimeLords">We may be strangers here, but this declaration is not unexpected.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentSignedTimeLords">The Riftborn find most things in this universe intolerable. Not you though. We tolerate you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentAcknowledgedTimeLords">I must confess, this culture of sycophancy baffles the Riftborn. Your flattery falls on deaf ears. The most important thing is for a being to know its true nature.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultSignedTimeLords">Most things in this universe cause us a sense of disquiet, but you truly repulse us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultAcknowledgedTimeLords">Insults, like compliments, only matter to the insecure.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandSenderProposedTimeLords">Your strong-arm tactics only shame your race. You should stop.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandReceiverSignedTimeLords">The Riftborn cannot act in any other way. I guess you would call us "determinists". The only freedom you have is how you react to the pressure in your minds.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandSenderSignedTimeLords">We want to eradicate you. That's all.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandReceiverSignedTimeLords">We are not from this universe, we take little pleasure in enduring its reality, but we will fight to the death for our existence.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedTimeLordsPrepareWar">The Riftborn move to a war-footing. And our enemy is you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceWarToWarAcknowledgedTimeLords">Things only appear to change to limited minds. The truth is everything is still and eternal. This act of war is no surprise to the Riftborn.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementSenderProposedTimeLords">You will find the Riftborn efficient and reliable trade partners. An agreement then?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverSignedTimeLords">Our ability to rend matter into infinite forms is not so advanced in this universe. We welcome a trade deal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverRefusedTimeLords">Are we missing something? Why would we agree to this meager trade agreement?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementSenderProposedTimeLords">We confess to finding some science of this universe baffling, horrifying even. We wish to learn, and in return we can offer many insights.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverSignedTimeLords">You can help us understand why cats tossed from high buildings always land on their feet? The Riftborn are in.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverRefusedTimeLords">We have mastered the art of traversing across dimensions, influencing the flow of time, and embodying consciousness. You've learnt E = mc2. We'll pass.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersReceiverSignedTimeLords">The temptation to insulate ourselves further from this universe is welcome.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverSignedTimeLords">The Riftborn welcome this chance to move freely in your territory. Do not pry too closer into our affairs when you visit our domain though.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverRefusedTimeLords">No.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersSenderSignedTimeLords">This is not the time for engagement. Leave our territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersSenderProposedTimeLords">We struggle to understand and love this universe, but we are prepared to try. We wish to open our borders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIgnoredTimeLords">Disturb someone else.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfReceiverSignedTimeLords">You can call us Riftborn, for we are not of this universe.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfSenderSignedTimeLords">I am the Grand Viceroy of New Coroz. There is a right time for everything, and this is the time for us, the Riftborn, to introduce ourselves.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverSignedTimeLords">Isn't it strange to live in such a low-dimensional universe? So banal. Nonetheless, we welcome this chance to learn where the stars hang in the great firmament.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverSignedTimeLords">Our eyes shall be your eyes, and your eyes ours. This is prudent.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingReceiverSignedTimeLords">We hail from the shadows, and we are happy to return to the shadows. It is no matter.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementReceiverSignedTimeLords">This. Makes. Me. Euphoric! No more of your stinking goods spoiling our colonies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementReceiverSignedTimeLords">I imagine our sciences were too much for your ponderous, filthy meat-based brains to comprehend. The Riftborn do not mourn the revocation of this agreement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverSignedTimeLords">War is not a natural condition for the Riftborn. We accept this truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationSenderProposedTimeLords">War was a mistake; we have only ever wanted peaceful relations. We offer a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverRefusedTimeLords">After all the sacrifices we have made we cannot end this war in good conscience. We refuse your offer of a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverRefusedTimeLords">We have the measure of the galaxy. We do not need your star charts--and you shall not have ours.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverRefusedTimeLords">We Riftborn prefer to keep our movements to ourselves. You will not see what we see. The answer is no.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralPotentialTradingPartnerTimeLords">Trade is a strange concept, but seemingly fundamental to civilizations in this cosmos. We wish to be partners.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralPotentialFriendTimeLords">We bear no animosity, and perhaps can even be described as fond towards your race. At least as close as we are able to be.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFirstImpressionTimeLords">Your gesture suggests order and balance in your empire. Perhaps this universe is not all chaos.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementSameAlignementTimeLords">We occupy congruent spaces. Maybe time will see us forge closer ties.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGreatDeedsTimeLords">To see such dazzling logic, such clean moves . . . I am honored. The Communion will learn of your great deeds.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAskTributeTimeLords">We require Dust. Our reasons are not your concern, only our need. So pay us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouHurtMeTimeLords">We learn pain in this brutal universe. Pain caused by you. Soon you will be paid in kind.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouWereCruelToMeTimeLords">If viciousness is the hallmark of a superior civilization, then we wish to be considered an inferior one.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationGetOutAfterTrespassTimeLords">Do not think you can trespass so flagrantly without repercussions. You should know your enemy better before making such choices. Remove yourselves.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterTrespassingTimeLords">Even as a master of time, your presence in Riftborn territory tests my patience. Get. Out. Now. Or suffer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterColonizationTimeLords">We Riftborn prefer uncolonized systems, devoid of life. Dead space. The next time you colonize a system so close to one of ours we will come for you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionTimeLords">Know that you won't possess that system without a struggle. We are coming.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoColonizationProblemTimeLords">Your choice to settle that system is . . . illogical. Or are we missing something?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassMilitaryTimeLords">Riftborn fleets are mustering as we speak. Your military trespass will not pass without ramifications.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationRevengeTimeLords">Our race is unfamiliar with this concept of revenge. But we understand it can be a very curative act. So we will have our revenge.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarOpportunistTimeLords">It is not the nature of the cosmos we hail from, but we are not in our reality any longer, are we? We must become . . . hard. And merciless.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementProposePeaceTimeLords">Your empire . . . is magnificent. Perhaps we can be at peace?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDeceiverTimeLords">When you stand beyond time, all reveal their true nature. You are a deceiver. We will not forget this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockingExpansionTimeLords">We will sweep through this universe, and bend it until it is to our liking. First though, you must move aside.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSneakyDemandTimeLords">Tricksy creatures, aren't you? The Riftborn see you for what you are. Parasites, constantly taking, never giving. No more.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralOpenBordersAcceptedTimeLords">Good, the Riftborn are curious to learn more about your region--even if we might find it unpleasant at times.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementTributeReceivedTimeLords">We must seem like Gods. Your tribute is an act of faith, no? Sensible.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForExpansionTimeLords">Your expansive tendencies force our hand. Every other path has been analyzed--and found wanting. It is time for conflict.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersForProtectionTimeLords">We find this universe a cruel and capricious place. Others are not welcome. We make plans to close our borders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoAttacksSufferedTimeLords">You shine a light for others to follow. Perhaps the races of this universe can curb their hostile impulses too?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDemandAcceptedTimeLords">Sensible. Our demands should be met. But make no mistake, we are neither pleased nor displeased.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPositiveContractTimeLords">The Communion back in Coroz will be pleased with the terms of this contract. We applaud your political acumen.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoHostileActionsTimeLords">Peaceful interactions beget peaceful outcomes. Perhaps one day we will show you our universe, friend.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementUltimatumFulfilledTimeLords">The Riftborn laud your compliance. All is in harmony again.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAttackedUnitsTimeLords">Desist attacking Riftborn fleets immediately. Ignore this ultimatum at your peril.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumDisregardedTimeLords">Are you certain you have the measure of the Riftborn? We are not of this universe, after all. The next ultimatum you disregard may be your last.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightTimeLords">We Riftborn come to understand the brutal nature of this cosmos. For your repeated colonization of nearby worlds, we ready ourselves for war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassingTimeLords">We observe your fleets trespassing in Riftborn territory. Observe and condemn.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationColonizationTimeLords">Have I neglected to make myself clear? We Riftborn despise this universe, and all its children. Your recent colonization efforts in nearby systems are not welcome.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersTimeLords">Riftborn space is now closed to outsiders. We wish to contemplate our place in this cosmos--in peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightNoClosedBordersTimeLords">Your attack ships are marvels of engineering, sleek and beautiful, but their presence in Riftborn space has become untenable. It will be with some regret when we cause their destruction.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAttackedUnitsTimeLords">Violence against any Riftborn will not be tolerated. We are interdimensional refugees with a natural right to sanctuary in this universe.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoBribeParagonTimeLords">Our codes must be strange to you. We are not motivated by profit, but rather the moral law within. Keep your bribe.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarLongPeaceBetrayedTimeLords">A strange interpretation of a peace treaty. As you wish. You will find the Riftborn a capable and enduring enemy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutScienceAgreementTimeLords">Our sciences leap time and space; you would learn much from us. In return, you could educate us to the nature of matter in this universe.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutTradeAgreementTimeLords">Trade is not our strength, but we can make many objects that you would covet. We consider a trade agreement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralMercantileThinkingAboutTradeAgreementTimeLords">My race is understandably suspicious of others. But I try to convince them of the value of trade with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulPeaceAcknowledgementTimeLords">When we came into this universe, the idea of befriending other species was inconceivable. Thank-you for changing our preconceptions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulTradeAgreementAcknowledgementTimeLords">The exchange of consumer goods for mutual profit is more satisfying than we first imagined. And useful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulScienceAgreementAcknowledgementTimeLords">The physics and chemistry we learn from you is fascinating, but it is in the biological realm where we are truly astonished. We hope you find our sciences as enriching.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandTimeLords">We are surprised you demand when asking may be sufficient.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyTimeLords">We ponder on the purpose of your incursion into Riftborn-claimed space with your battle fleets. The less charitable might think you agitate for conflict. But that's not the case, is it?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedSovereignSpaceTimeLords">We demanded that you not trespass or make demands, and you heeded us. But does that make us hypocrites?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationIsolationistPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumTimeLords">We didn't want visitors. Especially ones with weapons. We now seek a return to more unsympathetic relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyUltimatumTimeLords">Be warned: remove your military fleets from Riftborn territory or we will deploy singularities and other measures to ensure our security.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandAndNoGestureTimeLords">A demand with nothing offered in return? Make a gesture! And, no, we don't mean another gesture like that!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumTimeLords">We find your military posturing in our space threatening--as well as tedious and immature. If these are your feelings, let's re-establish the appropriate relations. Cold war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedNoTrespassTimeLords">We are not certain if it was mere coincidence, but the removal of your battle fleets from our territory is welcome. Now we can go gangbusters with all our weird interdimensional stuff without your prying eyes. Joke!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeNoGestureTimeLords">So, we wanted a nice gesture, and you gave us the middle digit kind--the Mavros taught us that one. Anyway, we're petitioning for a new cold war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerMadeGestureTimeLords">I guess that qualifies as a gesture of the appropriate kind . . . thanks for softening the pain of the demand. Don't make that mistake again.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingSenderSignedTimeLords">The Riftborn seek to learn, but not selfishly. Shall we share vision?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingSenderSignedTimeLords">Trust is ephemeral in the best of times. Now, it is gone. We rescind our vision sharing agreement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingSenderProposedTimeLords">The Riftborn would see what you have seen of this strange galaxy, and offer you our maps in return.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedHelpTimeLords">We are losing a war. Will you fight alongside us if we offer an alliance?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedCounterOtherAllianceTimeLords">Alliances elsewhere dictate that the Riftborn consider an alliance with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedHelpTimeLords">Our peace is welcome. Perhaps it can become an alliance so that we might end the war we fight sooner? We will make a proposal soon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedCounterOtherAllianceTimeLords">Other races find common ground . . . Isn't it time we built on this peace to become an alliance and counter their threat? We will propose something soon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceAgainstCommonEnemyTimeLords">Your enemy is my enemy. Would it not make sense to build on this peace and form an alliance to crush our mutual foe? Expect a proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForGoodRelationsTimeLords">Much of this universe displeases us--but not you. We are thinking of cementing this peace with an even deeper bond--an alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForVictoryTimeLords">How strange that we are so different, yet we follow similar paths to victory. An alliance would make a logical choice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNeedMilitaryHelpTimeLords">We don't call on you without good reason, but now we seek the help of our allies. For war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralHelpingAllyTimeLords">The Riftborn will always stand with their allies. We will send military help soon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGiftTimeLords">We value our relationship, ally. Hence the gift.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGoodGiftTimeLords">The Riftborn will always go the extra step for their closest allies who give us solace in a hostile universe. Enjoy our gift.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandNoGiftReceivedTimeLords">Is it not considered rude to make demands of an ally--especially without offering anything in exchange? We make plans to exit this alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandTimeLords">Are we mistaken? Are we not allies? No, we are allies. So why are you making demands of us?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementVeryPositiveGiftTimeLords">We can control time, travel between universes, but this gift is still very welcome. In fact, it has made amends for your past mistakes in this alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralWeakGiftTimeLords">Your gift isn't enough to excuse your previous behavior. We have endured many hardships up to this moment. If this alliance collapses we won't mourn its passing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoHelpThenNoGiftReceivedTimeLords">We should've known not to trust on your help. We will always be outsiders to this universe, won't we? Long live the alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementReceivedHelpLateTimeLords">Yes, the Riftborn have noted the sluggishness of your response to our call for help. Most disappointing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoHelpReceivedTimeLords">So, our Endless-borne "ally" shows its true colors. We are not surprised. Please prove us wrong by sending help.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemNoGiftTimeLords">You have a strange idea of the meaning of alliance. Do allies convert their partners' systems into their empire without recompense? We will end this alliance soon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemMultipleTimeLords">Time reveals your true nature. Despite our pleas you continue to convert Riftborn systems to your cause. Expect this alliance to end.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAwokeGuardianTimeLords">Another outsider to this universe. We welcome the awakening of this guardian on our world as we share many feelings.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRootedMySystemTimeLords">Forgive us, but these tendrils remind us of the blight spreading through Coroz, even though they speed our passage through this galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarAmAlreadyAtWarTimeLords">Attacking us while we fight on another front? We see there is little honor in this universe. Your time will come. Rest assured.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarNoRoomToExpandTimeLords">The galaxy forces our hand. We are penned in like domesticated animals, and our only path is through your empire. You would do the same.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPlayerAlreadyAtWarTimeLords">You must understand. We are the last survivors of an entire universe; you are one of many races native to this universe. We must do whatever we can to increase our chances.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralBlockadedSystemAtWarTimeLords">Your blockade is unwelcome. What do you hope to achieve?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAttackedCiviliansAtWarTimeLords">May the cosmos judge you for your heinous attack on innocents. The Riftborn will not forget.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAwokeGuardianAtWarTimeLords">The raising of this creature on our world breaks all the conventions of war. We condemn this action in the strongest terms.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDestroyedMyPlanetAtWarTimeLords">You destroy our world, but you destroy a part of yourself too, for we are not of this cosmos. Maybe one day you will feel the pain and anger we do.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleAtPeaceTimeLords">The Riftborn offer their gratitude for the beneficial singularity; we were considering placing one ourselves but now we can cast our attention elsewhere.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleAtPeaceTimeLords">Well, that singularity shouldn't go there. What gives?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemUltimatumTimeLords">Peaceful assimilation is preferable to violent takeover, but we'd prefer no Influence conversion of our systems whatsoever. Refrain!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDisregardedConversionUltimatumTimeLords">Obviously, we have more to learn regarding how to make effective demands. This continued peaceful converting of our systems means we will be ending this peace as soon as possible.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRespectedConversionUltimatumTimeLords">We are somewhat stunned. Beings of this universe can respond to reason, and respect outsiders. Thank you for not converting any more of our systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleTimeLords">It is perhaps ungracious, but in placing this beneficial singularity at such a time, we Riftborn wonder about your motives. Should we be worried?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleTimeLords">The singularity you place on us is an affront, but at least we know your intentions. What an awful place this universe is.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockadedMySystemTimeLords">Your blockade escalates tensions for no good reason. If you have a point to make, make it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedMyPlanetTimeLords">We thought we'd left behind the wanton destruction in Coroz. Maybe we are cursed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementOutpostCompetitionWonTimeLords">Logistics is the Riftborn's specialty. We were always going to win the outpost race.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionLostTimeLords">Somehow you won the outpost race. This is rather embarrassing for a race that prides itself on its mastery of time and logic.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoTributeReceivedTimeLords">The demand for tribute was not in jest. Your failure to pay will have repercussions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredOfBorderUnitsTimeLords">Keep your fleets at a safe distance. We Riftborn have fought hard for our territory.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementMovementBonus1VampirilisTitle">Ark Drive</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementMovementBonus1VampirilisDescription">Lessons learned from the propulsion systems of the giant Arks have resulted in smaller and more efficient engines that still provide improved power. Ship speed increases; hail the Virtual Saints!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementPrivateersTitle">Prepped Bases</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementPrivateersDescription">A first, pragmatic step towards using non-nationals as troops (officially or unofficially) is that two key types of bases must be built. First, anonymous and deniable outposts for the privateers to use; second, coordinated home defenses to ensure safety should the mercenaries decide to bite the hand that feeds them...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementEmpireManpowerStockBoost1Title">G-War Camps</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementEmpireManpowerStockBoost1Description">War on a galactic stage requires highly energy-consumptive construction, training, and supplies. Without advanced power systems, these recruitment and development centers would be impossible.</LocalizationPair>

Now that technology has rapidly developed to the point where colonies are autonomous, stable, and productive, most factions tend to adopt a 'hands-off' policy for laws and regulations -- in return for a constant supply of cash.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementApproval2VampirilisTitle">Center for Holy Tithe</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementApproval2VampirilisDescription">The need of the Vodyani people to extract Essence is seen by some subject populations as a curse. The construction of this religious center, however, provides a place where citizens can contribute Dust, rather than their Essence, to the Protectorate. The matter of finding other citizens, desperate enough to provide a bit of their Essence for some of the collected Dust, is handled far more discreetly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementApproval3Title">Wellbeing Foundation</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementApproval3Description">Building on cultural invertics theory, the Wellbeing Foundation can raise population approval levels by organizing and promoting public events that will reflect well on the system leadership.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementShip1Description">Building on Autonomous Construction technology, shipyards are able to integrate data from the empire's fleets--from deep space, from battle, from stellar anomalies--to construct vessels at the absolute cutting-edge of ship design. As a result, new vessels leave the shipyards as if they'd already spent considerable time in the great beyond.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementShip2Title">Quantum-damped circuits</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementShip2Description">A great obstacle to the development of increasingly small integrated circuits is that at small enough chip scales, quantum particle and field effects interfere with the intended operations of the transistors. By using quantum damping technology, however, these parasitic effects can be bled off so the circuits perform as intended at less than five nanometer scales.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementShip2CraversTitle">Craver Dark Ops</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementShip2CraversDescription">By sending Craver crews on intense, brutal training programs, fleets enjoy elevated experience levels straight out the nest.

The perfect choice for when you need to convert excess industrial capacity into cold hard Dust. Just keep an eye out for outrageous 3D designs....</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustryToDust2Title">Emergency Labor Policy</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustryToDust2Description">Persuading the majority of your system to give up their free time and work instead is no easy feat. It takes deep insight into alien psychologies, motivational tricks, and some really snappy slogans. When you do have this capacity though, Dust revenues--at the expense of industrial output--can become insane. Make Everything Great Again!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustryToDust2VenetiansTitle">Political Theater</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustryToDust2VenetiansDescription">Manufacturing a Lumerian scandal that sees system-wide industrial output plummet to zero is a risky business, but the additional revenues generated by the rapt population can be worth it.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementWonder3Description">In order to apply necessary controls and regulations to the activities of the innumerable financial and commodities market, a giant, intergalactic, quantum-connected central office must be built to ensure that trades are executed as fairly, quickly, and legally as possible. One advantage is that whoever controls the center has the freedom to levy and determine taxes; a necessary decision to counter-act the cost of the construction.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementWonder3EffectOverride">Gives the ability to set and collect marketplace taxes as well as learn insider information regarding the identity of the buyers and sellers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementWonder4Title">Ministry of Truth</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementDustToLifeforceTitle">Alms For Essence</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementDustToLifeforceDescription">Most souls give their essence freely, understanding they are contributing to a higher glory in their sacrifice. The Church of the Virtual Saints, however, is a lively religion and its hunger for essence is insatiable. The sacrifices alone are often never enough. Sometimes it is necessary to offer incentives to the craven, the greedy, and the weak. So we do.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementGrowthFromLifeforceTitle">Holy Proliferation</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementGrowthFromLifeforceDescription">Essence is the lifeblood of our civilization, the beating heart of the Church of the Virtual Saint, and a whispered echo of ancient eras when our Endless elders sailed the Heavens. It gives us inspiration and strength, but perhaps the most vital use of essence comes from the sacred act of concord, when we immerse empty Cloths in its vitality.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemDecolonizeImprovementRazeDescription">Sometimes things don't work out, and on a scale too big to ignore them. You have the choice to raze all signs of civilization from the entire system, including inhabitants. It's an ugly-but-necessary slash and burn on a planetary scale.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemDecolonizeImprovementPillageTitle">Vacate System</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemDecolonizeImprovementPillageDescription">Sometimes things don't work out, but in this case you get to recoup some of your investment.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementSacrificeGuardian2Description">A long and exacting process, this event requires the voluntary sacrifice of a Guardian population.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementQuestGlobalCompet05Description">These centers for the study and capture of gamma energy must be built above planetary atmospheres, which absorb gamma rays. As gamma rays—and particularly those emitted by astronomical anomalies—are by far the most powerful naturally occurring form of radiation, these centers provide rare opportunities to advance scientific knowledge. If their actions are coordinated, they could also send a directed pulse to a neutron star and briefly destabilize its powerful magnetic field.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementCuriosity1Title">Honeycomb Scope</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementCuriosity1Description">Reverse engineering the Endless scope discovered at a dig site proved a fruitful endeavor.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementUniqueCuriosity3Title">The Rejuvenation Maze</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementUniqueCuriosity3Description">Displaying the usual hallmarks of Endless engineering, this orbital structure has been given the name The Rejuvenation Maze on account of its ability to repair vessels by unknown means. Sadly, this understanding didn't come without a price, and several crews lost their lives before researchers realized that any ships sent into the maze must be unmanned. Now ships are auto-piloted on an entry vector, whereupon powerful electromagnetic fields feed the vessel into the hidden interior. Tracking data has revealed that ships travel a complex route through the structure, but what happens along the way largely remains a mystery.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementFood1Title">Evolved Soils</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementFood1Description">Using lessons from hardy strains of bacteria and extremophilic eukaryotes, basic soil biology can be changed to improve nutrition and waste cycles. These changes will, however, propagate planet-wide over time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementFood2Title">Alien Grafting</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementFood2Description">A first step in creating hardy, sustainable (and non-toxic) local crops is to integrate known genomes and physiological adaptations into alien ecologies. Using advanced biochemical techniques, combinatorial genetics of known and alien plant types, new and relatively harmless produced can be joined.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementFood3Title">Aquaculture Dome</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementFood3Description">By taking advantage of water-borne nanites that can purify and enrich underwater ecologies, these "aquatic greenhouses" allow populations of any size to grow super yields of algae, mollusks, fish, and other seafood. These domes are especially beneficial on planets that already contain plenty of life.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementIndustry1Title">Industrial Zones</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementIndustry1Description">Every new planet has its own specificities and challenges. Before great leaps can be made in exploiting a planet's resources, the first step is to adapt known and reliable industrial processes to the new environment. By overcoming challenges in transport, energy, and finance, a firm base for development can be created.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementIndustry2Title">Geo-industrial Plants</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementIndustry2Description">These vast complexes serve a number of critical industrial functions: Production of geothermal energy; mining of planetary cores for specialized materials; advanced materials and geological research; advanced study of plate tectonics.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementIndustry3Title">3D Replication Plants</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementIndustry3Description">It was a large and complicated engineering task, but the creation of a planet-wide system of smart materials plus improved logistics has brought this world to the point where any industrial object can be 'printed' in a local factory. While the bonus to production is obvious, the complexity of the infrastructure becomes a dominant factor in the economy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementScience1Title">Exoscience Stations</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementScience1Description">Data is the lifeblood of science. As new planets are discovered, field scientists set up systems to measure and analyze the biology, geology, and meteorology of the planet and its atmosphere. Collecting, filtering and exploiting this information is a first and critical step.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementScience2Title">Citizen Science</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementScience2Description">Inspired by the bonds between dry mathematical models, historical records, and the lived experience of past or future races, planetary populations are happy to partake in Citizen Science programs. These schemes are especially effective at generating Science in colder climes, where many more artefacts of the past are likely to have survived.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementScience3Title">Global Tech Park</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementScience3Description">A majority of the planet has been converted into an enormous research institute. Relatively non-polluting, high margin, and education-intensive, it draws companies and agencies to develop the next generation of galaxy-changing technologies. In addition, telepathics can be either augmented or diminished to improve group brainstorming or individual concentration. The cost of the infrastructure is high, however, and other industrial development is necessarily minimized.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementDust1Title">Colonial Exchange</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementDust1Description">Founding a colony is both complex and expensive. Using funds and technology from the government and investors, skills from the colonists, and raw materials from the planet, a system must be created to handle investments, loans, salaries, project finance... and taxes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementDust2Title">Atemporal Finance</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementDust2Description">The discovery of transport via faster-than-light travel and wormholes has added complexity to simple calculations of Net Present Value and rates of return. The development of Atemporal Finance is a new branch of finance, governing cases where space is a variable as important as time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementDust3Title">Finance Commission</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementDust3Description">In order to effectively execute trade and finance in a relativistic frame of reference, new regulatory systems and laws are required in order to control some of the new and unexpected effects of space-time on traditional investment structures. A major agency has been set up, and as it attracts financial institutions, lobbyists, economists, and speculators, it begins to have a major effect on the planet's development.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementInfluence1Title">SPIN Project</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementInfluence1Description">The Scrupulous Politics In the News project uses various forms of government control--audits and investigations as well as access to information, politicians and sites--to ensure that only the most fair and balanced image of the government is made public.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementInfluence2Title">Edenization</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementInfluence2Description">This program integrates marketing, propaganda, urban planning, and theme park design into a single project. Turning a planet into a place perceived as an "ideal" of modern living creates appreciation, and even jealousy, in other peoples and planets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementInfluence3Title">Bio-Enhancement Facility</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementInfluence3Description">In this state-of-the-art complex, a planetary-wide program of mental enhancement can be rolled out for the entire population. Liquid nanites with sophisticated control algorithms and delicate receptors can be injected straight into the cerebral cortex via the spinal cord, offering synaptic cleaning services. Farsighted thinking is enhanced, resulting in better public discourse, and a more influential population.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementResource1Title">Slag and Sludge Center</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementResource1Description">In any refining or extraction process a certain percentage of the end product necessarily ends up as waste due to declining yields and increasing costs required to extract and purify it. With these centers, even infinitesimal amounts of precious materials can be recovered and exploited.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementResource2Title">Self-Mining NPO</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetImprovementResource2Description">These technological wonders are rockets that are fired to Near Planetary Objects. Once landed, they build and operate autonomous mining operations, sending the refined ores back to their home base.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationConstructionTitle">{0}: Colony</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetConstructionFormat">{0}: {1}</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationArcticTitle">Colonize Arctic</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationArcticDescription">The ability to colonize Arctic-type planets is largely thanks to the invention of graviton-powered thermal tech. Without this tech, the first colonists tasked with terraforming these harsh worlds, would undoubtedly freeze or starve to death. And that's never a strong foundation for conquering any planet.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationAridTitle">Colonize Arid</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationAridDescription">Utilizing evaporation suppression tech that spun-off from developing warp insights is vital for building life-sustaining systems on arid worlds. With water more easily kept in its liquid form, death from dehydration becomes unlikely rather than expected. Don't start having any pool parties yet though.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationBarrenTitle">Colonize Barren</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationBarrenDescription">Barren planets lack atmospheres, often for excellent astronomical or gravitational reasons. By utilizing insights into non-baryonics to create controlled plasma domes around large areas of a planet or even entire planetoids, artificial atmospheres can be created and traditional colonization can begin.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationDesertTitle">Colonize Desert</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationDesertDescription">Desert ecosystems are famous for their fragility. With low water levels, delicate soils, and intricate (and easily upset) food chains, they are difficult to reliably and sustainably develop. In fact, their colonization would not be practical without a greatly improved understanding of how to retain water.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationJungleTitle">Colonize Jungle</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationJungleDescription">As they teem with animal and plant life, Jungle-type planets can be difficult to colonize. Medical supplies are critical to deal with the plethora of exotic fungi, bacteria, poisons, secretions, pollens, spores, and, of course, teeth and claws.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationMonsoonTitle">Colonize Monsoon</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationMonsoonDescription">Surviving the mighty rainstorms that can wrack Monsoon-type worlds might be thought the biggest challenge to colonizing these planets, but there are other challenges like dealing with the microbial disease that can spring from vast flooded plains.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationLavaTitle">Colonize Lava</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationLavaDescription">For obvious reasons this planet type is nicknamed "Shake-and-Bake". Due to their active, volcanic characteristics and excitingly lively plate tectonics, the major hurdle to colonizing Lava-type planets is the creation of sufficiently robust and tremor-resistant buildings and public infrastructures. That are, of course, also fireproof.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationAshTitle">Colonize Ash</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationAshDescription">Attempts to colonize Ash-type planets without some form of topological control has a long history of failure. Life-sustaining habitats desiccating to the point of death and greenhouses succumbing to irreversible desertification were not unknown. Fortunately, with improved technologies these problems are a thing of the past.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationOceanTitle">Colonize Ocean</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationOceanDescription">Generally rich in life and highly prized for colonization, Ocean-type planets present two major problems: The first is developing a stable aquaculture infrastructure that provides all needed nutrients. The second is dealing with the unimaginably powerful storms and waves that can traverse the entire world with no land to inhibit them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationTerranTitle">Colonize Terran</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationTerranDescription">The greatest risk to colonizing Terran-type planets is taking their apparently 'friendly' ecosystems for granted. Rigorous scientific testing and analysis are required to study the atmosphere, food chains, proteins, and carbon and nitrogen cycles. In spite of their apparent compatibility, they can be full of rude surprises.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationTundraTitle">Colonize Tundra</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationTundraDescription">Improvement of the system by which sap moves through weather-resistant plants results in the creation of crop species that can survive harsh weather via freezing and thawing. This opens up many opportunities for colonizing previously uninhabitable areas.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationSteppesTitle">Colonize Steppes</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationSteppesDescription">Crops. It's all about the crops on Steppes-type planets. Or, rather the lack of crops. The grasses may look innocuous, but over the ages they have strangled each and every challenger. Colonists' crops don't stand a chance, unless time and money is invested into adapting and engineering new forms of agriculture.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationSnowTitle">Colonize Snow</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationSnowDescription">The discovery of wave function powered energy sources provides a basic source of power on cold, wet planets. They can be further improved to self-evolve in order to better adapt to extreme conditions such as snowstorm-rich biomes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationVeldtTitle">Colonize Savannah</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationVeldtDescription">Occasional megafauna can make colonizing Savannah-type planets a difficult endeavor--no one likes to deal with aggressive beasts with sharpened claws, tails, talons, or unknown appendages before breakfast, after all--but by and large these worlds are easy ones on which to plant roots.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationTropicalTitle">Colonize Mediterranean</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationTropicalDescription">Though objectively beautiful, the environment of Mediterranean-type planets can be harsh. Soil is often poor, rainfall limited, and summers harsh. Adaptation of both shelter and agriculture is required to survive in this relatively austere biome.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationBorealTitle">Colonize Boreal</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationBorealDescription">Cold and moist, Boreal-type worlds provide challenges for settlers and industries that are often seduced by clever marketing brochures whose photos were taken in summer. Though potentially welcoming and productive, much of the year the environment is forbidding and must be treated with caution.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationForestTitle">Colonize Forest</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationForestDescription">Provided your potential colonists aren't dendrophobic (afraid of trees), Forest-type worlds with their wealth of food and fuel will provide little trouble for settlers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationSwampTitle">Colonize Toxic</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationSwampDescription">Colonization of Toxic-type planets relies on inventions that master the various systems needed for filtration and drainage, as deadly chemicals and radiation are often abundant in the atmosphere and soil. The environments are deadly and unforgiving if these processes are not executed perfectly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationIceTitle">Colonize Ice</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationIceDescription">Cold and surprisingly dry in spite of their ice sheath, Ice-type planets can be forbidding to colonize. Often windswept and hostile, few habitats are sustainable unless they are embedded within the frozen surface of the planet and heavily insulated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationAtollTitle">Colonize Atoll</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationAtollDescription">A great difficulty of colonizing Atoll-type planets comes from the profusion of microbial life found in and around coral reefs, which can have devastating consequences for non-native species. Carefully monitoring water conditions and controlling microbial blooms is necessary for these planets whose biodiversity is largely marine.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationGasFrozenTitle">Colonize Ice Giant (Frozen)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationGasFrozenDescription">Essentially giant balls of supercooled elements, these planets generally consist of oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. Temperatures in the upper atmosphere can drop as low as -200°C. As a result, colonization requires technologies to draw heat from the planet's core.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationGasColdTitle">Colonize Ammonia Giant (Cold)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationGasColdDescription">As unpleasant an environment as one could imagine, these very cold gas giants (below -120°C) have atmospheres primarily made of ammonia. Maintaining sealed habitats is a must for colonization.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationGasTemperateTitle">Colonize Vapor Giant (Temperate)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationGasTemperateDescription">The clouds in this type of gas giant, whose temperatures range from -100°Cto -20°C, tend to be made up of water vapor. The key risks for colonization are focused on the extremes of gravity rather than a poisonous atmosphere.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetColonizationGasWarmTitle">Colonize Cloudless Giant (Warm)</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00L04Title">Long-Term Knowledge Program</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00L04ShortTitle">Brains over Bucks</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00L04Description">A number of acts are passed that channel public funds into research, both private and public. While it is not cheap, the senators who back the measure are convinced that in the long term it will pay off handsomely.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00L06DictatorshipShortTitle">Safe Skies Bill</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00L06DictatorshipDescription">More of a cosmetic measure than anything with bite, this law nonetheless significantly raises the happiness of systems with orbital fleets. How? Any fleet when in-system is mandated to maintain operational readiness, and fly scouting missions round the clock. In military terms it's equivalent to polishing a bayonet, but the public lap it up. Suckers.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L04Description">Focusing on the "good will" and "good Samaritan" aspects of the empire's faith, systems and peoples not part of the empire but within its sphere of influence gain an extremely favorable impression of the empire. By publicizing work done to feed and clothe the poor, provide shelter, and improve living conditions, populations of other systems become eager to join the empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L05Title">Seven Years of Plenty Celebratory Edict</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L05ShortTitle">Bountiful Harvests</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L05Description">Ironically known by all as the Bountiful Harvests Act (though few would have the courage to even whisper the words unguarded), this law does little to actually increase crop yields across the empire. Instead, the plentiful grain silos, legume stockpiles, and the rest, come from a harsh rationing imperative imposed on the populace by the religious high command.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L00Title">Orison to Divine Authority in Matters of Bloodshed</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L00ShortTitle">Righteous Fury</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L00Description">Whipping up your populace into a frothing mass of righteous indignation definitely has its uses when it comes to othering, bestializing (not always needed depending on the race), and ultimately smiting your enemies. Once made sacred through the power of the divinity, this law allows you to ignore closed borders and declare hostilities on Cold War opponents.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L07Title">Greater Glory Initiative (GG)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L07ShortTitle">Greater Glory</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L07Description">Religious fervor can be used to drive stability, or be a catalyst for war. This initiative assigns priests to ships and bases across the empire to conduct blood rituals and prepare soldiers for death.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L01Title">Factory Improvement and Productivity Enactment</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L01ShortTitle">Lower Fleet Costs Rule</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L01Description">As the war effort surges on, industry lobbyists have presented a law that would help them increase output at shipyards across the empire. Their proposal only asks for a few key safety regulations to be suspended, complete with promises they will internally self-regulate to 'minimize likely increased risks of workplace injury.'</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L02Title">Post-Theatre Exploratory Vessel Licensing Framework</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L02ShortTitle">Spoils Of War Act</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L02Description">This law, which underpins the licensing of scavenger vessels to scour the sites of space battles, is a powerful means of generating both finances and scientific knowledge. Specialized vessels agree to give a fixed amount of both Dust and debris to the empire for each enemy ship that was known to be destroyed, and in exchange they are permitted to keep the rest. Some crews have made fortunes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L03Title">Initiative for Managed Wartime Reporting and Dissemination</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L03ShortTitle">Us or Them Decree</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L03Description">Populations can become eager to wage war when the enemy is portrayed as being truly savage and inhuman. By forcing news networks to promote the reporting of alien atrocities and to present the armed forces as noble heroes holding back the flood, civilian eagerness to support military actions grows dramatically.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L04Title">Veterans' Preferred Opportunities Statute</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L04ShortTitle">Deadly Intent Bill</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L04Description">In order to increase both conscription volumes and the efficiency of elite troops, safety limits are drastically lowered and perks and bonuses are boosted. More volunteers and conscripts come to do more dangerous missions; ground battle becomes a true spear point for the military.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L05Title">Forced-Conscription Among Lesser Populations Act</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L05ShortTitle">Runts As Grunts</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L05Description">Popular among the majority, probably not so popular among the minorities from which their number are taken, this law makes it legal for the government to force-conscript ground fighters from minority Populations. The growth rate of soldiers from these groups doubles as a result.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L00Title">Celebration and Publicization of Present Hostilities Decree</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L00ShortTitle">Jingoist Joy Bill</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L00Description">A law any and every self-respecting lover of war--gun in one hand, banner in the other--can get behind. Because the population are so invested in the military-industrial complex (and all the shiny spectacle, parades, and, okay, killings, that come with it) not only do declarations of war have no influence cost, each active war actually boosts the happiness of the loons.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionHaroshemsTitle">High Quality Food Staples Act</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionHaroshemsDescription">Utilizing Haroshem insights into advanced agricultural techniques, this law mandates that all crops legally grown across the empire must meet minimal thresholds of nutrition, quality, and mineral augmentation. By producing high quality staples, food consumption decreases as the population don't need to consume as much for the same benefits.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionBenthysTitle">Societies and Communities Encouragement Paper</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionBenthysDescription">The Kalgeros evolved through very tight-knit communities with communal structures whereby Kalgeros young were raised in the treetops by the entire village.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionDeuyivansTitle">Science for the Good of All Act</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionDeuyivansDescription">Much can be learnt from the Deuyivans when it comes to matters of organizing technological research, especially within the sphere of empire development. With this law in place, the usual cut-throat, narcissistic pursuit of technological breakthrough by individual groups is improved by a more community-focused research program which can slash the scientific costs of empire development-focused techs.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionHisshosTitle">Emergency Conscription Measures Outside Borders Act</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionHisshosDescription">Hailing from a highly martial society, Hisshos are happy to bring in unknown and untrained volunteers into their fleets while on active duty away from home territory. Through their methods this law permits higher replenishment rates of manpower when outside borders.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionMavrosTitle">We Can Remember Things For You Wholesale Law</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionMavrosDescription">When it comes to curbing dissident feeling in an empire, nobody does it better than the Mavros. Blessed with an overflowing toy box of surveillance tools, sharp wits, and some mean firepower, anyone following Mavros' methods will enjoy far fewer feelings of discontent across an overstretched empire. This law enables crack squads to act autonomously in absolute secrecy to keep everything working.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionAmoebaTitle">Daily Civic Demonstering Mass Participation Program</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionAmoebaDescription">Perhaps there is no race in the galaxy more able to empathize with others than the Amoeba. Using insights from the consciousness-detaching species, this law teaches a civilization to understand other people's animosities in such a way that raises resilience, lessens aggression, and inspires feelings of security. As such, populations become more immune to diplomatic pressures.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionPilgrimsTitle">Speculative Dark Tracking Executive Order</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionPilgrimsDescription">Nobody knows how it works, not even the Pilgrim scientist mystics who resurrected the technology, but work it does. Via this legislation, ultra-clandestine research groups are given the go-ahead to establish deep space tracking technology based on controversial uses of Dust that involve patriotic volunteers, sensory-deprivation tanks, and copious amounts of liquid Dust.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionZvaliTitle">Virtual Recreations Emergency Measures</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionZvaliDescription">Although computer-generated realities almost led the Z'vali civilization to ruin, to this day the ability to allow populations to immerse themselves in escapist fantasies is a useful measure in times of hardship. Like when your system is blockaded by hostile forces.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionZvaliShortTitle">Drop In, Tune Out</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionEydersTitle">Dust Strikeforce Excavation Order</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionEydersDescription">One of the advantageous things about being at peace with another empire is the ability to go snooping around on isolated moons, asteroid fields, and planetary rings with little fear of major reprisal. This, together with some Eyder knowledge of how to detect Dust veins, means legislation encouraging secretive "treasure hunts" can be very lucrative.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionRemnantTitle">Focused Efficiency Task Force Decree</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00PopulationCollectionRemnantDescription">One thing at which the Remnants excel is an all-consuming and absolute focus on the task at hand.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP03QuestVenetians04Title">Trading Company Policing Program</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP03QuestVenetians04Description">Once on the books, this law mandates that Lumerian Trade Companies support local policing efforts in their HQ systems. Lip-service may often be the result--a couple dozen flak vests emblazoned with corporate logos, "entrepreneurial" community service programs for petty crims--but it makes the locals happy so who's complaining?</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00QuestTimeLords01Title">Non-Corozian Discrimination and Equality Act</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00QuestTimeLords01Description">Enshrining into law the idea that Riftborn must not discriminate against other races on the basis of their creed, biology, or appearance may not be a philosophy shared by all, but diplomatic relations are certainly made easier.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00QuestTimeLords02Description">It may offend Riftborn sensibilities, but enforcing that vessels be constructed from pre-existing materials rather than the usual practice of only using raw or regenerated elements means that ship costs can be reduced dramatically.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionCraversTitle">Cravers</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionCraversDescription">Created by the Endless from an insectoid life form, the Cravers are in the purest sense hunter-gatherers who would never have independently evolved the systems and infrastructure needed to raise crops or domesticate animals.
Their life cycle is based on consumption, and as such they are capable of digesting any form of plant or animal matter. As their home world is close to being consumed, they must leave in search of further nourishment. For if they do not continue to expand, discover, and exploit new worlds, their society will eat itself to death. Feeding the hive is their all-consuming purpose; the notions of 'treaty', 'trade', and 'peace' do not exist.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionSophonsTitle">Sophons</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionSophonsDescription">The Sophons are a curious, peace-loving race whose highest ideals are found in scientific knowledge and technological advancement. Keen to explore and understand the mysteries of the cosmos, they believe the universe is something to intellectually master. Although pacifist in outlook, and despite frail bodies not used to violence, Sophons can construct vessels of devastating offensive capability.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionVampirilisTitle">Vodyani</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionVampirilisDescription">Victims of a classic cycle of over-industrialization, the Vodyani were saved by technology culled from ruins of the Virtual Endless. These precursors quickly gained an aura of divinity in the eyes of the Vodyani, and are now worshipped as gods. Clothed in their great black suits of borrowed technology, Vodyani leaders pilot their great Arks across the star lanes, seeking other peoples to convert, control, and consume.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionVenetiansTitle">Lumeris</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionVenetiansDescription">The Lumeris are a society that revolves around trade, economic deals, economic growth, and doing business. Expansion and acquisition are the bywords of their culture, and as an amphibious people they are prepared to make money in any environment. Their society is organized around a series of families that have traditionally run different parts of their economy, and the balance of power and negotiations between the families is what drives progress--or blocks it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionUnfallenTitle">Unfallen</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionUnfallenDescription">The Unfallen have only ever known their homeworld of Koyasil, preferring to peaceably study what is near rather than discover what is far. They were content with this slow development that they refer to as the “Long Sleep”—the period from their rise to sentience to the modern era. The modern era was rudely thrust upon them by a galactic skirmish in the skies above, and the debris it rained upon their planet. Seeing fire fall from the skies, and viewing the violence of other races firsthand changed their image of their role in the galaxy. Having an intimate relationship with fire as both Fire-That-Destroys and Fire-That-Renews, they view themselves as guardians of peace and harmony in a galaxy that seems to be badly in need of both.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionHoratioTitle">Horatio</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionHoratioDescription">Incredibly wealthy and only slightly less deranged, Horatio was a trillionaire who left to discover his own star cluster. Finding a planet sprinkled with labs of ancient cloning technology left by the Endless, the boredom soon drove Horatio to create a race of allies, servants, and slaves who were every bit as gorgeous as the most beautiful person in the universe--Horatio. Once the planet was repopulated, Horatio the First had only to look up, regard the stars, and realize how much more beautiful they, too, would be if they were filled with... Horatios. The rest, as they say, is history.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionTerransTitle">United Empire</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionTerransDescription">The Empire is theoretically under the control of a central monarchy. However, the rate of expansion means that the society cannot be ruled that way effectively. In fact, the systems of the colonial diaspora are colonized by designated Corporations who work hand-in-hand with the Ministry of Investment and Development. The Ministry of Security is involved as well, due to the need for native and/or alien pacification, security forces, defense, and surveillance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionTimeLordsTitle">Riftborn</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionTimeLordsDescription">Hailing from an alternate dimension orthogonal to the Endless universe, the Riftborn would've happily led out their abstract, timeless existences entirely ignorant of galactic strife, were it not for a breach that precipitated a disaster of unimaginable proportions. Like a poisoned blade slashed deep into clean flesh, the rift acted as a source of terrible disorder in the Riftborn's pristine, geometrical universe. Desperate, unable to halt the disease's advance no matter what they tried, the Riftborn took the last available course of action that might lead to their survival: Together with their strange time-shifting abilities, they stepped into the Endless universe.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionBotsTitle">Epistis</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionBotsDescription">Little remains of the Epistis' creators, a race that died out several millennia ago. What is known is that the Epistis were likely created as planetary guardians, charged with preserving their homeworld’s fragile ecology through aggressive defense of its natural wildernesses and the salvaging—and recycling—of discarded materials. Whether these objectives became corrupted, leading the Epistis to turn on their creators is unknown, but what is certain is that they are a fanatical, dangerous civilization of recycled warmachines ready to take their creed to whoever crosses their path.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionDeuyivansTitle">Deuyivans</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionDeuyivansDescription">As clever as they are grotesque, these denizens of gas giant planets are known for their scientific prowess. As beings that evolved on a Dust-rich gas giant, the culture and society of the Deuyivan are either incomprehensible or inexplicable. Therefore, to simplify communication they tend to adopt the names of other sentients that they meet.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionHaroshemsTitle">Haroshems</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionHaroshemsDescription">One of the older races of the galaxy, the Haroshem found a relatively stable evolutionary niche with their simple, pacifist culture that relied on advanced agricultural techniques to ensure their species was always well fed and lacked one of the basic motivators for conflict. With younger, hungrier races stirring up and down the arms of the galaxy, however, this straightforward, peaceful approach to life will be sorely tested.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionBenthysTitle">Kalgeros</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionBenthysDescription">The Kalgeros evolved from a marsupial-like species, and their relatively small size is countered by their surprising strength and agility. As they moved from protecting or conquering a tree to a tribe to a village, the society realized that its somewhat belligerent tendencies had to be channeled. Over time they developed a martial art that they call "Mardamari", unique in the galaxy for the number of limbs required to execute it. They are led by "gunga", spiritual and martial leaders who have the responsibility for moral and physical education. Jolly and gregarious in daily life, they are deadly serious in questions of combat and honor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionHisshosTitle">Hissho</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionHisshosDescription">The Hissho are a modern and civilized peoples descended from avian DNA. A race of highly competitive tribal warriors, their history is one of bloodshed, conquest, vengeance, and domination. While this has created a very hardy, aggressive, and dangerous people, it has also slowed their advancement and limited their numbers. When they did reach the stars to find other peoples waiting for them, their reaction was to conquer and dominate. Their innate and learned sense of flight makes them superlative pilots.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionMavrosTitle">Mavros</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionMavrosDescription">Though some view the Mavros as mere Sophon renegades, they are a different society with a  different mentality, even if they share much of their genetic code. While both enjoy tinkering, technology, and discovery, the Mavros have a tendency to use these things to plunder, pirate, and conquer. They are adventurers and scavengers who have almost as good science as their brethren but a lot more attitude. A common epithet of their bounty-hunting society is, "Unbreakable toys can be used to break other toys."
Often found as mercenaries and enforcers, the Mavros compensate for their small size by technology and belligerence.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionPilgrimsTitle">Pilgrims</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionPilgrimsDescription">Born from a mix of dissident scientists and intellectuals unhappy with the authoritarian rule of their United Empire government, the Pilgrims true calling came when they discovered a vast cache of Endless artifacts in the Kuiper-belt of an alien star system. Still living a semi-nomadic lifestyle as they fled United Empire retaliatory fleets, the Pilgrims developed a mystical fascination and reverence for the Endless. Friends with the Sophons, they are a blend of educated scientists and tattooed mystics, and have dedicated themselves to finding the Endless homeworld of Tor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionZvaliTitle">Z'vali</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionZvaliDescription">The history of the Z'vali is a tale of technology gone wrong. An intelligent bipedal race born on a cozy, resource-rich world, the Z'vali developed advanced computer systems long before they discovered any kind of viable spaceflight. Ever-more-complex software and simulations allowed individual Z'vali to have their every need fulfilled through computer-generated realities, eventually stagnating their economy and driving their whole world to the brink of ruin. Only the actions of a heroic few thrust the Z'vali civilization finally spaceward, away from their dying planet. Now they travel the galaxy in close-knit, nomadic communities. But there are those who wonder if the Z'vali people of today still think they are playing a long, detailed simulation of some kind.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionAmoebaTitle">Amoeba</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionAmoebaDescription">Indirect descendants of a group of Concrete Endless, the Amoeba devolved to primitive protoplasmic lifeforms and lost all their prior knowledge before re-evolving into a unique species with a special relationship to Dust. Blessed--or cursed--with the ability to detach their consciousness from their physical form and create group gestalts, the Amoeba developed a strong ecological mind-set, always striving for harmony and balance. Their goal is to travel, meet, and learn, though their relatively defenseless natural form has bred into them the need to master the physical environment.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionSheredynDescription">Sheredyn</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionTikananTitle">Tikanan</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionTikananDescription">A sharp lesson in the dangers of importing exotic wildlife, sometime in the last century a small contingent of Tikanan were brought to the human splinter colony world of Abelard for purported "zoological reasons". In fact, this marked the zenith of an increasingly dangerous game of one-upmanship by two factions on the colony world, who liked to capture and bring unusual species to their peoples. When a breeding colony of Tikanan escaped and disappeared into the wilderness, the human leadership played down the event, declaring that the unintelligent creatures would naturally die out. Ten years later, a hundred thousand Tikanan swarmed the human settlements, forcing the original inhabitants to flee. How they went on to evolve their own twisted civilization is uncertain, but what is clear is that they became much more adept than the mindless insectoids who'd arrived a dozen years earlier. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionEyderTitle">Eyder</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionEyderDescription">The small, dragon-like animals known as the Eyder were originally the genetically-engineered pets of an advanced spacefaring race that died from a ravaging plague. Left to their own devices in now-empty residences high above the surface of a gas planet, they multiplied and evolved into a society based on the ownership of Endless relics, as the number of these artifacts correlated closely with the ownership of better amenities and living quarters on the floating stations. Exposure to these Dust-laden relics expanded their consciousness, giving them control of a vast fleet of ships designated for beings much bigger than themselves.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionNirisTitle">Niris</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionNirisDescription">Hailing from a vibrant ocean-world, a short time ago the Niris' home planet wasn't always so brimming with life. A time of rampant expansion and population growth led to the ecosphere coming close to utter destruction. Today, endless miles of bleached coral, huge rusting industrial facilities, and the mass graves of extinct fellow sea-dwellers still litter the ocean floor. These act as a constant reminder to the Niris, and help sustain their ecological outlook on life. Now, among the remains, harmonious technologies maintain clean oceans and support a myriad of colorful life forms. Despite using inventive liquid tanks to traverse the land, the Niris are still most at home in water; the interiors of their space craft are more like verdant aquariums than typical sterile ships.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionGnashastTitle">Gnashast</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionGnashastDescription">A relatively recent addition to the isles of its home planet, the Gnashast are the descendants of benthic horrors that crawled onto the land a few hundred thousand years earlier. With the existing fauna ill-prepared to survive this new onslaught from the depths (especially as sea levels rose, lessening the amount of habitable land) the Gnashast quickly became the planet's primary predator; now entering the space-age they are still as aggressive as when they made their first forays onto the tidal flats of their homeworld. Not the most welcoming of races, the Gnashast nonetheless can make strong allies if well handled.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionBhagabasTitle">Bhagaba</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionBhagabasDescription">As avatars of a planet-sized "supercomputer" initially formed by the random movement of rocks and corals on their home planet, Teonha, which created a natural "transistor board" capable of simple thought, the Bhagaba are one of the galaxy's most unusual lifeforms. Some, in fact, will dispute that they are even alive at all, being mere puppets of a vast, alien mind with no will of their own. Despite this, with their pacifist outlook and sense of wonder, most races are happy to encounter the strange coral-like creatures who often come across as charmingly clumsy--which incidentally makes for a very good diplomatic strategy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionRemnantTitle">Remnant</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionRemnantDescription">Originally an ancient order of assassins created when the Endless ruled the galaxy, after their masters' demise the Remnant underwent a period of hibernation for millennia in the crypts of a forgotten moon. Numbering only a few hundred upon awakening, the Remnant would've spent the rest of eternity awaiting orders were it not for the actions of Belcus Akad-Talar, a highly-decorated member of the order who'd become Dust-augmented during its slumber. Connecting the digital minds of its fellow assassins through quantum entanglement, Belcus suppressed their inherent programming, and gave them a new purpose: to build a better galaxy for the most deserving race they encountered.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionPulsosTitle">Pulsos</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionPulsosDescription">The Harmony, a species of sentient crystal, traverse the universe seeking its mystical Core. Attuned to waves and radiation, their voyage was interrupted by the confusion that Dust wrought upon their senses and bodies. While most Harmony strive to pass beyond the Dust-tainted galaxy and continue their quest, the Pulsos are a Dust-infected subgroup that have decided to stay and study this mysterious phenomenon.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroSophons01Title">Fahemmn Nutharr</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroSophons01Description">Some believe that attention to detail is important; Nutharr believes that it is the purpose of existence. With an eidetic memory and an obsessively organized mind, he made a name for himself directing the construction of a new orbital platform without using a computer ("It's not so complex")--in his spare time. Bathed in Dust while inventorizing Kessler debris, he gained the capacity to manage and collate details on a level far beyond information technology. However, Nutharr finally discovered a worthy challenge in the governance of systems. In his words, "When you gotta plan for what a few billion people might or might not do, stuff finally gets interesting."</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroSophons02Title">Hanmharla Gerzi</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroSophons02Description">Born on a far-flung outpost near a Craver system, Gerzi's attempts as a child prodigy to study game theory were often interrupted by alarms, evacuations, and explosions. Tiring of the constant disruptions, Gerzi applied his formidable intellectual talents and understanding of decision modeling ("might do" versus "could do") to help a small defensive force harass and drive off a major fleet. Once he figured out just how much fun you can have with his chosen subject, Gerzi left the peaceful Sophon Cacophony, entered the Academy, and now eagerly causes trouble across the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroSophons03Title">Uthassum Rhamoezz</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroSophons03Description">Rhamoezz was born into a family that took its social responsibilities seriously, and grew up a concerned do-gooder and volunteer worker. Mocked for her love of social sciences by her mathematician friends, her widespread mastery of neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, linguistics, and cognitive computing nevertheless gave her a brilliant political career. When a colony ship she governed landed on a planet full of ancient ruins and unnatural topography, Rhamoezz was exposed to concentrations of Dust and gained an almost psychic capacity to predict and control the actions and opinions of masses of population.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroSophons04Title">Asaroenni Dzulmaran</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroSophons04Description">From a very young age, Dzulmaran believed that the sound of scientific experiment should not be "Ah-ha!", but something more like "Kaboom!". Chemistry was her early means to this end, but in high school and university she gleefully uncovered the ways in which cracking open atoms and exploiting electromagnetic waves could lead to even larger explosions. Dzulmaran was recruited directly from her graduate program by the tiny Sophon Defensive Options department, and since her strange experiments using Dust she has only grown more powerful--and dangerous.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroSophons05Title">Ahririnn Turlemmoz</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroSophons05Description">They say the colonies that form around multiple-star systems have the most unpredictable societies. Ahririnn Turlemmoz grew up in such a system, in a small colony orbiting three distinct stars. Due to the system's odd orbital period, Turlemmoz grew up in an extended harsh winter, where Sophons were consigned indoors and a minority population of Kalgeros labored outside to keep the colony alive. When a regressive Sophon politician proposed, years later, to encapsulate one of the system's three stars in a Dyson sphere, laying waste to the ecologies that sustained the native Kalgeros on less-developed planets, Turlemmoz took up arms. She used her Academy connections to organize political movements all over the System, toppling the motion by the narrowest of voting margins. She has since declared her allegiance to the Academy, and though she rarely visits home, she faces her challenges each day with no regrets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroCravers01Title">Malk Unbound</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroCravers01Description">"Obedience is expected; loyalty must be induced." Unbound learned to obtain uncompromising control over their drones by creating and exuding more potent pheromones. Transformed by Dust when gutting an Endless temple, he now uses their increased expertise to generate a sort of Dust-enhanced near-chemical-dependence among any sentient troops he leads. Unbound has now become not just a clever leader, but one supported by fanatical soldiers who are indifferent to danger and injury.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroCravers02Title">Risto Libera</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroCravers02Description">Due to their advanced skills in leading large construction projects Libera was sent to install a major Craver military base in an asteroid belt. The asteroids turned out to be a disused Dust storehouse, and Libera experienced Dust enlightenment like an adrenaline rush. Since then Libera has sought ever-greater and more complex challenges in management and development, hoping to repeat that surge of power and pleasure. The greater the difficulty, the greater the glory, the more powerful the reward…</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroCravers03Title">Kren Solutus</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroCravers03Description">The reputation of Solutus began as a simple soldier, when it gained the nickname Undying. Having fought and survived more battles than any other Craver, first as drone and then as bishop, Solutus voluntarily ingested lethal levels of Dust in its relentless search for greater strength and higher performance. Relentless to the end, Solutus has an impressive record of winning battles, or in the case of defeat, fearlessly returning for a rematch.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroCravers04Title">Oroyo Ner Freed</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroCravers04Description">One of the fraction of a percent of Cravers who become a queen, the Endless took Oroyo as a test subject in order to mutate her body to create eggs that would provide larger, stronger, more dangerous warriors. The advanced cybernetic systems they used proved too much for her simple Craver nervous system, and the resulting neuronal overload was almost lethal. The Virtuals decided to save her, however, and applied enough of their own technology to re-create her persona in an artificial brain. The side effects, unsurprisingly, were numerous. The explosive growth in brain capacity led to eidetic memory and a linked obsessive fascination for seemingly pointless data, as now she had the ability to note and track innumerable details. With this capacity, however, came a great deal of information that she should not have had, and Freed used her own enhanced intellectual capacity to infiltrate and spike the Virtual network--murdering the entire lab system in which she was being held. She launched herself on an Anti-Endless rampage--Concrete and Virtual alike--until the resources of a small fleet were turned upon her and she was finally captured and frozen for study. The details of how and why Hnifri Kabtuycha discovered and freed her have never been made public, though she is now available for hire as a freelance Hero.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroCraversPrimeTitle">Koros Apogee</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroCraversPrimeDescription">Koros was created as an advanced android prototype of its kind, built to convince other Virtual sects of the great value that Cravers could bring to the war effort. The shipment never made it, however, as the Virtual facility was hacked and Koros sat in stasis for uncountable millennia. Discovered by Academy archaeologists when they were searching Endless sites, he was brought to the Academy, awakened, and indoctrinated into the organization. It has stayed remarkably silent on its past and its memories, although it was certainly designed to build massive factories capable of replicating its own form.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVenetians01Title">Iotar Vos-Lancellum</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVenetians01Description">Once a rising star in the Lancellum family, Iotar Vos'Lancellum's reputation was left in tatters when he disobeyed the orders of a pureblood Lancellum Admiral on the eve of a massive battle. Lancellum ships had just made contact with a strange fleet of vessels that appeared near the Lumerian homeworld. In the chaos, Iotar rallied the Lancellum ships together to defend the homeworld but was wounded when his ship collided with an enemy vessel. In the ensuing battle an explosion of Dust destroyed every vessel except his own. Blamed for the loss of the Lumerian fleet, Iotar would have been court-martialed had he returned to Jenes. In the bloody aftermath, however, shadowy figures claiming to be from an organization called "The Academy" swooped in and peeled him from the wreckage. Possessing strange new powers and in search of answers, Iotar agreed to join the mysterious organization. Today, as he travels the stars, he still seeks to discover the origins of the fleet that attacked his people—and who, if any among his crew, had a hand in its assault.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVenetians02Title">Kolstya Velm-Omokar</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVenetians02Description">Kolstya Velm'Hopris'Omokar might have lived out her life as an ordinary dockworker, were it not for the day her wife became trapped in an asteroid mining facility. Watching in horror as the Meos leadership refused to fund a rescue mission, Kolstya took matters into her own hands, hijacking a scrapped mining drone and piloting it straight into the doomed asteroid. Through this desperate act, she was able to save her wife and the other trapped workers, but not without being exposed to vast amounts of pure Dust that was released on impact. Now Kolstya is a heroine among the Omokar labor unions, and has made powerful friends in both the Arrakyo and Lancellum families as a champion for the ordinary Lumerian. But fame and fortune have brought little happiness to Kolstya, for now she struggles both against the demands of the Academy and the plotting of the greedy Meos leaders. A part of Kolstya wants to throw her new life away and spend all her time at her wife's side, but another part knows her life was no longer hers the moment she hijacked that mining drone.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVenetians03Title">Yelchin Ordara-Arrakyo</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVenetians03Description">Yelchin Ordara-Arrakyo's parents were scientists dispatched to a deep space research station, so he never knew the life and culture of your average Lumerian child. Instead, Yelchin grew up playing in the desolate remains of the Endless. Ancient ruins and whispering computers were as much his friends as the other scientists. Visits to the homeworld were awkward and uncomfortable for the young Lumerian, who knew nothing of trade or deal-making, but everything to do with the names and records of Endless scientists, soldiers and scholars. When his parents mistakenly awakened an ancient Endless security system, Yelchin willingly raced to the heart of the facility to shut down the ancient power core. He succeeded—but in the process was exposed to a tidal wave of pure Dust that was vented into the room. His head now filled with far more than Endless arcana, and in need of somebody who could help him understand his new powers, he sought out the Academy. Now Yelchin is caught between two worlds: the mundane world of the people he is supposed to call kin, and the mysterious realm of the long-dead Endless.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVenetians04Title">Jenhaestra Drev-Meos</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVenetians04Description">Jenhaestra Drev'Dros'Meos was starbound for trouble long before the Dust of the Endless crossed his path. He'd built a stake among the Meos clan for being a Lumerian willing to deal in illicitly acquired goods. Strangely, Jenhaestra's ultimate goal was not extracting the highest profit on these goods, but the preservation of objects he believed might fall into more nefarious hands. When one of his brokers promised a chest of pure Dust from an Endless wonder, Jenhaestra could not possibly resist—but neither could he have predicted what would happen when he was exposed to its raw power. Now one of the most powerful financial operators in the galaxy, Jenhaestra is always happy to sell his services to the highest bidder. As well as being a canny investor, he is also one of the most well-connected individuals in the galaxy, and is always on the lookout for other priceless relics to add to his own private collection.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVenetians05Title">Brunem Berto'Lancellum</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVenetians05Description">Very bright but very happy to remain lazy, clever and wealthy, this scion of the Lancellum family was jerked out of his complacent lifestyle when the resort ship he was vacationing on was attacked by pirates. Taking an active part in the defense of the vessel, he found a taste for adrenaline that he did not realize he had. This led him to increasingly extreme sports, events, hunts, and activities, until the day when extreme speleology in an Endless ruin changed his life forever. Affected by Dust and suddenly capable of enormous feats beyond his comprehension, he turned to the only leader in the galaxy he judged capable of guiding and teaching him: Isyander St Shaiad, the founder of the Academy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroUnfallen04Title">Anaxagoras</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroUnfallen04Description">The Unfallen known as Anaxagoras found himself wandering a barren landscape after his exploration vehicle was destroyed by lightning. He wandered the empty landscapes for months singing and churning up the soil, until an expeditionary force from the Academy, seeking traces of the Lost, took him into captivity. From there he was delivered to the mysterious Academy, where he was to be studied as a seed of a new species. But Anaxagoras surprised everyone, including himself, by taking quickly to the computer systems used throughout the Academy. His wonder and fascination was exceeded only by his capacity for learning, and soon Anaxagoras had mastered the complex war games that others in the Academy played for entertainment. Now a fully fledged Hero, Anaxagoras enjoys his war games on a much larger scale -- though some wonder if he truly understands the destructive ramifications of his "play."</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroUnfallen02Title">Lunabarxes</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroUnfallen02Description">Lunabarxes had found her place -- or so she thought. Ensconced in a flowering grove in the center of a bustling forest metropolis, Lunabarxes was on the verge of metamorphosis into the final stage of Unfallen life when errant missiles, falling from the wars of some other species in the skies above her planet, erupted around her. Dust-fueled explosives tore up the boulevards and shattered the peace she had sought for so long. Though many Unfallen were thrown into madness, Lunabarxes had been so close to a state of final repose that she was able to pause, sink her roots deep, and slowly absorb and assimilate the Dust. The Dust gradually sharpened Lunabarxes's mind and senses, providing her so much more information and so many new intellectual vistas that she decided to put off the transition from being an exploring Second to becoming a sedentary Third. She now wanders the universe, calmly providing aid where she can -- and still looking for a place to call home.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroUnfallen03Title">Thustrellen</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroUnfallen03Description">Thustrellen loves the feeling of sunlight on his bark. As a young Second, he found his way across his system to another planet, inhabited by a primitive species. He rested there for years, providing shade and wisdom to the primitive local population. He never set down roots, however, because in his heart he knew there was an even better place for him out there in the stars; a place where he could be surrounded by even more life and warmth and sunlight. Now that the Unfallen have developed spaceflight and sought out new colonies, Thustrellen plans to accompany them -- and see what sort of grand adventures the galaxy can offer him.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroUnfallen01Title">Baramaxa</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroUnfallen01Description">Although the Unfallen move slowly and speak softly, they possess quick minds and a great capacity for learning. Baramaxa is such an example, an Unfallen that revels in the joy of learning and exploration. She has a scientific mind, and lent her talents for years to the analysis and discovery of the wealth of planets and astral bodies in her home system. Her experiments with life and death pushed barriers that others felt uncomfortable with, and some view her over-developed sense of curiosity with unease. Baramaxa, however, bears no guilt. As an Unfallen, she knows that there is no such thing as true death -- only a Long Sleep.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVampirilis01Title">Enav St Lyeaor</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVampirilis01Description">While the Vodyani are encouraged to seek and explore the truths of the Church, some adventurous types take this a step further and delve into the mysteries of the stars themselves. Enav was a simple believer seduced by the bright light of the stars, and became a well-known scout and explorer of the unknown voids between the lights. The third independent node he found, however, was a gas giant planet locked within a minor Dyson sphere--and still inhabited by living Endless souls. One of them, Lyeaor, is said to have made a bargain with Enav. Corroboration is difficult, however, as the Church has lost control of Enav's Cloth and of Enav himself. Though Enav continues to seek, explore, and follow orders, the lack of direct control over his suit has made the Hierarchs unsure as to whether he should be punished. Others argue that he has been touched by the gods, and it is no longer the role of the Church to question his actions. Others yet wonder whether Enav is still in there, and whether the being called "Enav St Lyeaor" should rather simply be called "Lyeaor"...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVampirilis02Title">Varb St Zouieina</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVampirilis02Description">If pressed to respond, Varb would indicate that his life began as a hydroponic farmer on a space station, a member of the Zolya Clan and a happy husband and father. When his system was taken by a Vodyani Ark ship and his people assimilated, Varb was one of the few whose spirits were deemed worthy to ascend to the gift of Vodyani citizenship. As mortal body was replaced by energy and Varb donned his Cloth and became a member of the Protectorate, little remained of the anger at his family's death and his own transformation. As a soldier of the Vodyani, Varb came to execute his duties professionally and faithfully. His attitude changed forever when he touched a ruin on a barren world, and came into unprepared contact with the living spirit of Zouieina. This Virtual, dying slowly in an underpowered site, was glad to find redemption and life as a Vodyani saint. While Varb felt a trace of amusement from Zouieina at the notion, the powers that his Cloth assumed from the spirit and the abilities that he gained were exceptional. Unhappily, Zouieina awoke in Varb memories of a lost family and of other ways that a people might choose to live. Torn but triumphant, overtly efficient but silently in turmoil, Varb is a hero who is not sure where he will stand when great Penance comes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVampirilis03Title">Klev St Seiotia</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVampirilis03Description">An archaeologist and theologian, Klev found joy in the complexities of Endless ruins and history. Klev was therefore a noted professor and field researcher before her contact with a Virtual spirit, deep in a lab on a Vodyani Ark. The Virtual, known as Seiotia, had lived within an artifact from an Endless archive for millennia and quickly struck a deal with Klev that changed the latter in fundamental ways. For a moment Klev saw the blinding light at the start of time, the bleak void at the end, and a glimpse of the unthinkable vastness of everything that might happen in between. She saw also, and stood upon, the brink of her own insanity as her mind attempted to breach and process that scope. While she has risen to the top of her profession and now runs entire Arks and systems, it is said that Klev thinks long on questions of free will, purpose, and the grand design of the universe during the long nights of sleep that she no longer requires.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVampirilis04Title">Daro St Taiage</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVampirilis04Description">Daro was known as "The Burning Brand' for her eager and relentless proselytization of minor peoples. Ever eager to bring additional souls into the fold and to free spirits from their physical prisons, the Fount upon her Ark never lacked for sacrifices. Her worldview changed one day, however, while rounding up recalcitrant Kalgeros who were hiding in an Endless temple. Touched by the presence of the Virtual Endless who called itself Taiage, Daro came face-to-face and soul-to-soul with one of her gods. The reality of this knowledge shocked and altered her profoundly. Still driven to serve a god, and yet sharing her Cloth with its presence, Daro now alternates between burning with faith and aggression and fearing what ultimate sacrifice her symbiotic saint may require of her. What is the recompense for sacrifice? What is the ultimate act of fidelity? It is one thing to act as if believing your god follows your every movement and thought; it is quite another thing to live that way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroHoratio01Title">Farella -EM8 Mario 22</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroHoratio01Description">Farella -EM8 Mario 22 is the survivor of a brief rebellion of poorly batched clones that tore through his childhood center, leaving his friends and teachers dead and Farella's young face hideously scarred. As growing up with a marred countenance in Horatio society seriously damaged Farella's academic and professional prospects, he searched for decades before discovering risky Endless grafting sciences in an abandoned medical station that permitted him to reproduce his face perfectly. Though on the surface he now appears healed and happy, the trauma of rejection, contempt and isolation has certainly left its invisible scars.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroHoratio02Title">Andro Camille -Z</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroHoratio02Description">Andro Camille -Z is the only remnant of a Horatio gene pool that was designed to mix with other species on mutual projects. Andro emigrated to a mixed colony outpost at an early age and grew up around Sophons, Mavros and Deuyivan citizens; this gave Andro a respect for rational thought and experimentation that he later found difficult to reconcile with existing, somewhat shallower Horatio philosophies. He spearheaded scientific development on several major Horatio projects until, at the height of his career, he purposely exposed himself to Dust in an effort to increase his own multitasking abilities.

Now a powerful and influential Academy-trained governor, he spreads his unique blend of scientific and luxury-focused politics across the galaxy. Andro is grateful to the Academy for his training, but as a child of multiple cultures, believes sincerely that the Academy is only a small part of a larger galaxy with trillions of individuals in it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroHoratio03Title">Salario Domus -63</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroHoratio03Description">To master Dust requires great emotional stability as well as an intimate knowledge of oneself. Unfortunately, Salario Domus -63, a blue-collar worker in the desert region of Tareste, possessed neither. His accidental exposure to Dust sent shockwaves through his town's sleepy urban center as Salario, empowered with a vastly enhanced intellect, rapidly took control of all major shipping and commercial corporations. Driven by the need to experience ever more new and stimulating sensations, he eventually abandoned the over-exploited environment of Tareste and joined the Academy, where he received training in controlling his newfound intellectual abilities.

Thankful for helping him to channel his urges, Salario bears an intense respect and loyalty to the Academy. As a governor he is overbearing and supercilious, but tends to gets results wherever he is assigned. He has sworn off any affiliation to the Horatio (at least officially), but it is whispered in certain circles that Salario is secretly constructing a large cloning facility of his own...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroHoratio04Title">Ruthian -F11 Tighina</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroHoratio04Description">Ruthian -F11 Tighina is the product of a very strange situation: a short-lived reality program on his home planet that rewarded the "winner" with a surprise concentrated dose of Dust exposure. Unable to physically handle the shock, Ruthian ended up in the hospital, locked in a coma that lasted sixteen long years. When he awakened, he had lost many of his social connections and a large chunk of his life, but gained incredible mental abilities. This sent him into a serious depression, an issue that he struggles with to the present day.

Thankfully his exceptional talents gained him rapid admission to the Academy, and after a long period of training Ruthian now seeks to rebuild his bond with the people of the galaxy--and especially with the Horatio community that he was cut off from so long ago. Ruthian has become a reliable fleet commander and logistical expert, and is unswervingly loyal to his superiors.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTerrans01Title">Immah Naratya</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTerrans01Description">Most generals send soldiers to their death by ordering them to the battlefield. Immah Naratya has cultivated a different reputation. As the United Empire's most efficient logistics officer she acquired the reputation of mastering brutally efficient supply lines, working men and women to the bone to make sure factories, shipping lines, and dockworkers kept the Imperial Navy afloat and functioning. 
But someone had other plans for her. While touring one of the Empire's factories, a messenger delivered a mysterious package that upon unsealing exploded with pure Dust. Suddenly her view of the workers toiling to their deaths changed drastically. 
Most exposed to pure Dust gain depth in logic, wisdom, and understanding, but Naratya gained the whole emotional spectrum that had been suppressed for so many years. She knows not if she can trust the Academy, for she suspects they were behind the Dust attack, but every day she finds her loyalty to her Emperor fading just a little. All she knows is she must make amends for the lives she ruined with her work. She seeks a balance between the intellectual firepower she was born with, and the newfound compassion granted to her by fate.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTerrans02Title">Dominik Havanen</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTerrans02Description">In the press, Dominik Havanen might have been one of the most celebrated business leaders of the Empire, but among its corporate leaders, he was hated and reviled. Clinging on to a fortune whose origins trickle far back into the history of the United Empire, Havanen built his name by picking a sector of the Imperial economy at random and snapping up stock ownership in various corporations. 
He acted with such impulsiveness that none could predict his next financial move--he tore his allies apart and swallowed their businesses into his own, then threw grand parties for his enemies and invited them into the fold. Havanen is a man so unpredictable, he once secured a supply of pure Dust to see what would happen when he exposed himself to its effects.
The results were so frightening even the Academy didn't appreciate his presence. Havanen seems interested in only one goal now: pure galactic instability. Though for the right price, he may be willing to bend that chaos to another's cause.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTerrans03Title">Oleg Lagarin</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTerrans03Description">Oleg Lagarin's life was pitifully ordinary for a citizen of the United Empire. Conscripted at age eighteen. Dropped into the most average battalion possible. Sent to die as cannon fodder while assailing an insurgent fortress. Struck down by a stray artillery blast. In the heat and haze of battle, his exosuit blaring warning signs about his vitals, he readied himself for death.
But death did not come. A reservoir of pure Dust poured out of the cracks opened by the artillery, and Lagarin was suddenly overcome with more strength and vitality then he'd ever known in his life. The after action reports confirm several witnesses who watched him rise from the ground, roar, and barrel toward the enemy fortress, smashing a weakened wall with his battle-wracked exosuit.
Such heroics earned Lagarin praise within the Empire, but the man still does not know peace. In the quiet of night, he still smells the sick haze of that battlefield, still hears the cannon roar in the distance. And as reality slips away and he returns to that dark place, visions of other mysterious creatures enter his vision too . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTerrans04Title">Dmitri Lenko</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTerrans04Description">The younger brother of the Emperor's personal bodyguard, Hadri Lenko, Dmitri decided to forge his own path away from his brother's rising star. Signing up for early United Empire prospecting missions to help map the hinterlands of the home system, Dmitri helped develop several critical industrial facilities in the Kuiper belt. Rugged and determined as he was, Dmitri found his best skill wasn't his labors though--it was acting as a placatory influence on the inevitable daily squabbles that broke out between competing prospecting firms. Squabbles that could often be fatal if not resolved. Eventually tiring of the petty disputes, but not ready to return to Raia, Dmitri launched himself into the newly discovered starlanes. After years of wandering the galaxy, he stumbled upon the Academy . . . Impressed by Dmitri's ability to sneak deep into the facility before being discovered, the Academy Leader decided to bring him into the fold . . .</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTerrans05Description">A child prodigy in strategic games, Muldaur grew to be a feared and respected competitor long before adulthood. Driven by pirate attacks to join the Mezari military, she assiduously trained her technical and martial skills to be the equal of her mental abilities. Her advanced analytical abilities turned out to be her downfall, however, as she found herself less and less content to follow orders that to her were obviously impractical or wasteful. Eventually getting drummed out of the Navy for insubordination, Muldaur returned to a life of fighting pirates until she was captured by Vodyani slavers. Broken out of captivity by Isyander, she became a loyal follower and one of the key founding faithful of the Academy.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTerrans07Description">Vladimir Kiminiski only wanted to serve a quiet life for the Empire. He was loyal, praised the Emperor, worked hard in the farms. It was too bad then, when he mistakenly delivered a freighter of his goods to an Imperial black-ops cell, and was kidnapped and experimented on as punishment for his error. 
In a matter of weeks, the humble farmer was turned into a monstrous soldier, and dispatched on a berserker mission from which he wasn’t supposed to return. 
But return he did. And vengeance returned with him. Somewhere out in the black of space, Kiminski was exposed to pure Dust, but he may be the only Hero in the Academy who has not revealed where, how, or why. This puts him at an uneasy relationship with the Academy leaders, but his hatred for the Imperial scientists who tortured him means he will serve loyally for any who can point him in the direction of the fools who turned him into a monster.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTimeLords01Title">e</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTimeLords01Description">When the rift tore a hole in the very fabric of the Riftborn's universe, most of e's worldmates fled in terror. Not e. Fascinated by the universe on the other side of the rift, e was one of the first Riftborn to begin analyzing the tear--and one of the first to seriously consider breaching the Endless universe. This curiosity led to e piloting the first craft through the rift and into the galaxy with a small team of empiricists. Unfortunately, contact with the home dimension was lost, and e and its team became stranded on a barren, rocky nomad world passing through a red-supergiant star system. Despite making great strides in understanding the complex ecologies of the planet, the rapidly receding star meant the world grew colder and colder. One by one, e's teammates succumbed to the freezing temperatures. When things seemed utterly lost e had an epiphany though. Setting up an emergency beacon, e used the cold to put itself into a state of suspended animation. Eventually rescued by Haroshem scavengers, e was brought to the attention of the Academy who were more than happy to bring e into their fold.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTimeLords02Description">A key figure in the establishment of a base of operations on the snowy wilderness of Vanguard, [pi] ensured that the Riftborn presence in the Endless universe grew in a swift and orderly fashion. Although eternally grateful for [pi]'s help, the Grand Viceroy's relationship with the administrator grew increasingly difficult on account of [pi]'s extreme pacifism. Believing Riftborn activity in the galaxy always needed to put the rights of other sentient organisms first and foremost, [pi] was a constant thorn in the Grand Viceroy's expansion plans. Eventually tiring of [pi]'s objections, the Grand Viceroy sent the Riftborn administrator on a mission to learn what it could of the other races of the galaxy. [pi] quickly came to the attention of the Academy when its deep analysis of Hero sightings throughout the galaxy allowed it to narrow down the location of the fabled institution to within ninety-odd star systems. An invitation to join rapidly followed. Today [pi] offers its services to the highest bidder.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTimeLords03Title">[sum]</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTimeLords03Description">Warfare may have been an alien concept to the Riftborn in their previous existence, but that didn't prevent [sum] enjoying a natural aptitude for the subject. After helping to defend the beachhead on Vanguard from vicious attacks by native snow wolves, [sum] volunteered to command the Riftborn's very first military fleet on a tour of the local system. Set upon by pirates in the ice fields of the outer reaches of the system, [sum]'s agile tactics helped protect his ships while driving off the attackers into interstellar space. Upon return to Vanguard, [sum] negotiated with the Grand Viceroy: in exchange for free movement in the galaxy and the opportunity to learn battlefield strategy from the great warfaring civilizations, [sum] would first found a military school on Vanguard to help safeguard its fellow Riftborn. The Grand Viceroy agreed, and soon after establishing the school [sum] set out for distant stars. Many famous victories followed, but the most significant battle for [sum] ended in defeat. Barely escaping with its life, [sum]'s life raft was caught in the aftershock of the capital vessel's explosion, enduring a hail of high velocity Dust. Somehow, this event augmented [sum]'s mind--and the paucity of its strategy became crystal clear. Humbled, [sum] interpreted the experience as the Gods teaching it a lesson. [sum] still had much to learn.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTimeLords04Title">[derivate]</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTimeLords04Description">Although somewhat religiously minded before the explosion of the Gray Owl ripped a hole in the Riftborn's universe, afterwards [derivate] became one of the most holy figures among all of its kind. Being at the epicenter of a Dust explosion can do that. Saturated with Dust, [derivate] found its mind overrun with revelatory visions concerning the Riftborn's future. How the blight would spread. How they would traverse the multiverse. How a savior would step up . . . Preaching to any who would listen, [derivate]'s words were first considered the ravings of a demented being, until its prophetic auguries slowly came to pass. Afforded respectability, [derivate] became a powerful, persuasive voice and was instrumental in the Riftborn's decision to venture into the Endless universe, going against the ruling Communion who initially counselled for caution. Whether [derivate]'s allegiance still belongs to the Riftborn is uncertain, but what cannot be disputed is its fierce inner belief that Dust is the secret to ruling the universe.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroBenthys01Description">So great is Ninpere's knowledge of luxuries that even the most indulgent of the Lumeris listen rather than speak when she is talking. Notable primarily for her expertise in drinks and particularly cocktails, she was given the honorary rank of "Sira" for not only creating the most expensive cocktail ever known, but also the most accessible across diverse species and the most-nearly-but-not-quite-lethal. When one adds to this her encyclopedic knowledge of perfumes, flavors, organic chemistry, food processing, and fine dining, it is clear why her opinions and presence are sought at the finest establishments across the galaxy (it is a secret known only to her that this exceptional talent is due to an impetuous over-sampling of Dust-based drinks). Regardless, Ninpere’s knowledge and her agreeable company are both in great demand.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroBots01Title">EPISTIS "Madein" 20910</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroBots01Description">From the moment of its flash inception, when code breathed life into its silicon mind and fired impulses through its articulated chassis, EPISTIS-20910 considered itself a most divine receptacle. The first thing the robot saw upon opening its mechanical iris was an engraving on its forearm assemblage: "Madein". Thinking this a name of special significance, EPISTIS-20910, carried out its duties of preservation and salvaging with even more fervor than its devout siblings. When an unlucky scavenger landed on EPISTIS-20910's world, it wasted no time eliminating the intruder before claiming his craft. Curious as to where the intruder had come from EPISTIS-20910 blasted off into space . . .</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroDeuyivans01Description">Taking his name from the Endless leader he met during his first trip off his gas-giant homeworld, Neuil's early forays across the galaxy involved applying his knowledge of game theory to financial models--and making a lot of investors seriously Dust-rich. Life would've proceeded along these lines, but for an event that Neuil still struggles to understand. Caught in a ferocious electro-storm in the upper atmosphere of his homeworld while transporting a vast motherlode of Dust, Neuil experienced an intense "living dream" where he found himself tumbling through a dazzling-white, Euclidean-shaped void. For a brief time, shoals of colored motes of light darted around his vessel--and then the next moment he was waking up back in his craft with his mind afire. Adrift in deep space, the constellations seemed completely unfamiliar . . . What did it all mean? To this day, Neuil still seeks answers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroHaroshems01Title">Wud Svez</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroHaroshems01Description">Wud is more than just ecologically-oriented; he has been quoted as saying "Only idiots create garbage.” Obsessed with re-use and re-purposing as far back as he can remember, his skills at recycling took a definite turn for the better after he attempted to recycle an Endless wreck into radiation-proof roofing and was enveloped by a cloud of Dust. Now that his skills are beyond even the level of a genius, his ability to adapt, refinish, recycle, hack, and improvise has made him a figure of awe across the galaxy. Though his vision of a “trashless cosmos” has not come true, the stock prices of waste disposal companies plunge to near-zero value whenever Wud makes a planetary stop.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroHisshos01Title">Fusha Keencrest</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroHisshos01Description">Already as a youth on Uchi, Keencrest was known as a "warrior’s warrior". Dedication, selflessness, and a relentless drive made him a terror in competition and set an impossible example as an officer. Running security for a team investigating Endless wreckage in the planetary rings of a gas giant, Keencrest came face-to-face with an automated defense android. Outmatched and facing death, he managed to incapacitate it with a single, desperate riposte. He quoted himself in explaining this attack: "Even if defeat seems certain, retaliate." Dust liberated by his android opponent infused his body, and Keencrest rose from being a warrior's warrior to being a warrior's deity. No longer capable of finding worthy opponents, he continues to hone his ever-increasing range of skills as a Hero.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroMavros01Title">Krak "Cubed" Bleis</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroMavros01Description">While many Mavros have a reputation for hot-headedness and explosive tempers, Krak always had a cool demeanor and a very un-Mavros-like willingness to solve problems through careful planning rather than heavy explosives. This earned him the nickname "Cube", which became "Cubed" when he saved his team from decimation three times during a treasure hunt in a booby-trapped Endless hulk. Krak's unusually long periods of silence during this expedition, however, were due to the fact that he had ingested enormous quantities of Dust due to a faulty filter system in his suit. Driven to a higher level of thinking, Krak soon said goodbye to his thankful squad and set off to find new challenges in infiltration, decryption, and problem-solving.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroPilgrims01Title">Mwanga Moto</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroPilgrims01Description">The Pilgrims and the Sophons share a deep historical connection, going back to the Pilgrims' very origins as an offshoot of the United Empire. Mwanga Moto, an orphan child raised in a mixed Sophon-Pilgrim foster home, experienced the joys of faith and science at their best, learning to discover and inquire, counsel and hope. All that changed on his fifteenth birthday, when marauding Epistis pirates attacked. With his siblings he was forcefully conscripted into his hab dome's military, and deployed in pitiless combat. The accompanying war and ruin spiraled uncontrollably throughout his home system, eventually resulting in its complete destruction. Mwanga Moto departed his childhood home in critical condition aboard a medevac ship, eventually arriving on the steps of the Academy as a Dust-addled refugee. Though he is now grown and free to choose his own path in life, he has retaken up the mantle of the soldier, attempting to rediscover the peace of his childhood through the only means he now knows.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroZvali01Title">Norn D'Girit</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroZvali01Description">Norn D'Girit believes that the universe he lives in is a simulation. While the Z'vali culture from which he hails has long wrestled with the indefinable differences between real and virtual spaces, Norn, an Academy-educated technocrat, believes that the implications of his research may go far beyond what any other philosopher has proposed. But while his scientific views may be kooky, his management skills are formidable: Norn has taken up a nomadic existence, traveling from empire to empire offering his services in exchange for scientific funding. Unfortunately, the support he receives is often scant. It seems that the thought of everything -- families, nations, planets, systems, galaxies -- being some kind of advanced fabrication is simply too frightening -- or detached -- for the majority of people to wrap their heads around. There is always more pressing research to be funded, so Norn is always moving on . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroAmoeba01Title">Ay Seer 1.2Gado</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroAmoeba01Description">As a highly social species, many Amoeba enjoy discovering, cultivating, and nurturing their surrounding environments in collaboration with their intricate social groups. Not so with Ay Seer 1.2Gado. An extremely ancient member of her race and a gifted chemist and physicist, she prefers solo exploration and scientific inquiry above all else -- to the bewilderment of her peers. Independent to the point of solipsism, 1.2Gado is an adept user of Dust, having honed her instinctual skills to mastery through careful study at the Academy. Rumor has it that while attending the Academy, 1.2Gado could not be stopped from conducting dangerous experiments on her fellow students, and was forcefully and prematurely graduated as a result. She is now available to all major empires for mercenary services.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTikanans01Title">Eighth of Fifteenth of Karval</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTikanans01Description">Eighth born of the fifteenth generation in the Karval colony, Eighth of Fifteenth rapidly rose to a position of prominence among her hivemates during a period of particularly intense fighting with a nearby colony. Internecine warfare between colonies is nothing unusual in the ebb and flow of Tikanan society, but what made this outbreak of fighting exceptional was Eighth of Fifteenth's leadership. Employing never-seen before tactics backed by an iron authority that brokered no disobedience, Eighth of Fifteenth routed the entire enemy colony, forcing Tikanan Overwardens to issue their first-ever cessation of standard Tikanan diplomacy. Subsequently recruited by one of the old Abelard survivors who'd stayed in-system after the Tikanan's uprising, Eighth of Fifteenth eventually came to the attention of the Academy whereupon she was invited to really expand her military repertoire. She maintains to this day that her abilities have nothing to do with Dust exposure.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroGnashasts01Title">Torvoth Bzech'Grul</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroGnashasts01Description">Born in a tidal flats' slum, Torvoth grew up at the violent end of a violent society. Consigned to the fighting pits when he came of age, Torvoth was headed for an early grave until he was found by an Academy Servitor tasked with discovering potential recruits from the fringes of the galaxy. Feeling sorry, but not that sorry, for the young, beaten fighter, the Servitor would've walked away had it not been for what happened next. Torvoth, curious as to the identity of this unusual spectator, tracked--without detection--the Servitor to his hidden vessel, hijacked the craft, and somehow overrode the launch protocols. There was only one explanation: Torvoth was Dust-enhanced. The Servitor offered Torvoth a way out: Unwavering allegiance to the Academy in exchange for escape from this brutal life. Torvoth didn't need to be asked twice. After accompanying the Servitor on the rest of his mission, Torvoth developed a ceaseless yearning for adventure, before heading to the Academy where his real training began.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroEyders01Title">Scales Galena</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroEyders01Description">Life in the Galena habitat of the great space station Excelsior was a bucolic existence for Scales until the outbreak of the Schisms. Whereas previously she would spend her days gliding through the station's vast halls, worshipping Endless relics, or staring at the languid movements of the gas-giant far below, the time of the Schisms forced her to take stances on all manner of political questions. Who should lead? Were the Eyder of Galena habitat morally superior to those of Mitrovic? Where should the great relics be kept? However, rather than finding these debates stultifying, Scales found them electrifying, and quickly became one of the most skilled orators on Excelsior. Finding strength in her Faith, Scales was instrumental in healing the Schisms, but afterwards found herself restless. One day she left decided to leave Excelsior forever and seek more challenges among the stars. The rest, as they say, is history.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroNiris01Title">Eli Leandra</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroNiris01Description">Half a lifetime ago, if anyone would've told Eli he'd one day be trawling the galaxy under the guidance of a mysterious organization named the Academy, he'd have said they were hallucinating. At that time Eli was part of the Niris' "rewilding" movement, dedicated to reviving the areas of the ocean that had become exhausted or polluted. His days were spent swimming freely in the seas, cataloguing the diminished ecosystems and living very simply. Slowly, he became an accidental leader-figure in the movement, organizing research parties, and determining long-term strategy. One day, exploring a partially-sunken mining platform, Eli got trapped when an industrial drill fell and pinned his body. Unable to escape, when the tide receded Eli found himself stranded above the waterline. Close to asphyxiation, only the appearance of a strange visitor prevented Eli's death. "You are Dust-blessed," said the stranger later. "Come with me, for the Academy has a place for you."</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroBhagabas01Title">5748-A27P-TZR</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroBhagabas01Description">When an alien craft crash-landed on the Bhagaba supermind homeworld of Teonha, TZR was one of the first to arrive at the scene of destruction. Dozens of coral-kin lay broken on the reefs, but inside the blackened shell of the craft TZR did find one alien survivor--a four-eyed beast with ferocious teeth and scaly skin. Hauling the unconscious creature out of the vessel, TZR was nonetheless caught in a final explosion, and a rain of Dust-infused hail lashed its mineral carapace. Rather than being terminal, however, the experience was enlightening. Unlike its puppet-esque coral-kin, TZR became blessed with a sharp, independent intelligence, and in time learnt to communicate with the recovering alien. Whereas the creature wanted to stay on Teonha, TZR was consumed with wanderlust. In exchange for reverse-engineering the alien's craft, the supermind agreed to let TZR leave. Now it sails the stars, seeking encounters with more races.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroRemnant01Description">Entrusted by the Remnant leader, Belcus Akad-Talar, to scout the rest of the system after the order of cyborg assassins awoke from their long hibernation, Kalin was exploring a remote windswept tower on a nearby planet when its connection to the hive-mind was severed. Whether this was due to Dust storms, computational failure, or sabotage was unclear, but the result was that Kalin was suddenly alone with its buried past. Overwhelming memories of tracking marks across ghost-worlds, hiding in the holds of interstellar vessels, and killing under myriad suns flashed through its silicon mind. On that day, the one-time assassin vowed to learn everything it could about its history, and set off the stars. Alone.</LocalizationPair>

Analyzing their tools and societies to understand more of the powers and possibilities contained in Dust, Caxalxsixox fulfills a lonely if important role. Regardless, while the leader travels, soaking up knowledge and transmitting it back to the Pulsos using their innate mastery of quantum coupling, the others bask in the data stream that Caxalxsixox creates, forever recording and studying.</LocalizationPair>

Largely silent on matters of the past, nobody knows exactly what sort of life Reyaryn led at the time of the Endless, or what brought his virtual self to be embedded in an industrial-purpose exosuit. What is known is that Reyaryn is a powerful presence wherever he goes, seemingly possessed with an uncanny ability to predict the next move of friends and enemies alike. As to a weakness, some whisper that he is afraid of visiting the original Endless homeworld . . .</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%QuestHeroEndless02Description">With its faith in science and society ruined by the butchery at the Lodestones, Tiaych was one of the renegade Endless who created the Tabernacle of Remorse in order to warn future civilizations of their errors. After completing that monument it drifted for ages, an inconsolable and indifferent ship-borne mind in a vast galaxy. It was indifferent to life or death until, centuries later, the ship systems failed and it was captured by the gravitational field of a neutron star. While it was content to study the star for several millennia, Tiaych has over time regained its sense of purpose and now desires to be free of its electromagnetic prison. Should a starfaring civilization come to its rescue, it would be more than happy to assist them as thanks.</LocalizationPair>

How long Anax-Jink lived in this manner is unknown--even to itself--but when strange visitors settled on its homeworld, it had its world turned upside-down. Hailing from another dimension, the Riftborn awakened new curiosities in Anax-Jink, inspiring it to seek new answers to new questions. Still a believer that the end-of-days is coming, Anax-Jink is viewed with a blend of disgust and fascination by its Riftborn masters. Luckily, the Grand Viceroy is one of Anax-Jink's biggest champions, not least because the Riftborn believes that the Virus knows powerful secrets about the world of Vanguard.</LocalizationPair>

After demonstrating his skill and bravery in numerous encounters, Hadri was recruited into Emperor Zelevas' inner circle of Sheredyn Protectors where he carried out many covert missions for the Emperor before himself becoming First Protector.

Possessed of a willful, rebellious streak, Lena's most significant choice came early into her adulthood when she chose to begin a secret affair with Duke Anatov, a sworn enemy of the Alliance of Nations--the protean form of the United Empire. Although Anatov was subsequently killed in the final stage of the Great Continental War, his bloodline continues through Lena's only child, Viktoria. After her daughter's birth, Lena dedicated herself to her religion, often disappearing for months on spiritual pilgrimages.</LocalizationPair>

Upon rescue, Petra made no mention of her fortuitous find, but rapidly rose in the empire's newly formed Academy of Sciences thanks to the exposure. Today she heads Advanced Research, the United Empire's military science branch, and has personally spearheaded the development of several terrifying technologies.</LocalizationPair>

Investigating this extraordinary technological leap, the scouts eventually met a battered robot who introduced itself as OPBot DV8. It explained that after drifting through space for quite a bit and subsequently crashing on this planet, it was rescued by the natives.

As the Amoeba were headed to the Academy she decided to go with them, in spite of the pleas of her heartbroken partner, Sego, and her angry boss, Nico the Psycho, who viewed her skills as a ticket to riches. Thanks to her skills with flight technology, she has since made a name for herself as an inventor and test pilot of new and improbable craft and their uses in battle.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetUnfallenDescription">An ancient world, its origin lost to the mists of time, Koyasil's entire landmass is now one vast, primeval forest. How long ago the Unfallen rose from the gloomy, silent woodlands is uncertain, but most historians who have studied the species of the galaxy place them as one of the oldest. In the depths of the forest, a sense of timelessness reigns supreme, and it is said a fallen tree will lay undisturbed for millennia, its very fabric becoming another layer of the forest. The Unfallen strive for little, content in their ageless world, but the stirrings of younger races across the galaxy has awoken something in Koyasil . . . something ancient, mysterious, and powerful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetVampirilisTitle">Tchinomy</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetVampirilisDescription">The home planet of the Vodyani was a poor yet temperate world, and the fragility of its environment meant it was soon depleted. As a result the Vodyani were driven into space by necessity, and already have a long history as a ship-bound people. Though their civilization is now tied to their Arks, their planet of origin remains a powerful symbol both as a lesson in ecology and as a memory of the weak and grotesque forms they had before Virtual technology allowed them to evolve beyond that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetTorTitle">Tor</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetTorDescription">The Endless society developed on this large, cool planet, orbiting a star that they called Prime. Though it is the birthplace of this culture that dominated the galaxy for centuries, they were forced to depart when over-exploitation destabilized the core and crust, triggering seismic changes. Though it is a treasure of artifacts and holds a near-mystical reputation, its history is one of sorrow.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetKyrosTitle">Kyros</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetKyrosDescription">Kyros, when discovered, was a planet whose environment was so welcoming that it was taken by many pre-Dust Endless sects as their promised paradise. Unfortunately, conflict and strife exploded over its care and exploitation, and a "grey goo" nanobot plague was unleashed as a suicidal Doomsday weapon that destroyed the biosphere. It exists today only as a memorial and object lesson.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetAurigaTitle">Auriga</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetAurigaDescription">This garden planet was used as a biological laboratory by the Concrete Endless, with myriad experiments run on both native and alien life forms. A site of major conflict during the Dust Wars, the environment degraded and the surface of the planet was eventually covered in ice. While there are rumors and expeditions that claim to have uncovered miraculous ruins and the vestiges of great empires, today Auriga is an icy tomb.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetBilgeliTitle">Bilgeli</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetBilgeliDescription">A hospitable--if dry--planet, rich in natural resources, Bilgeli served as the base for the Endless research stations that were built in its orbit. One of them in particular, Letum, has a fairly legitimate claim as being the first place in Endless history where the science of virtualization was perfected. For better or for worse, this fact has given it an important role in the mythos of the Endless civilization.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetTerransTitle">Raia</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetTerransDescription">The first Mezari starships arrived millennia ago, landing on a green, virginal--and empty--planet of breathtaking, fecund wildernesses. Today, Raia proudly shows its pioneering, frontier past as it tamed the wild lands and storm-wracked seas, its landmasses now brimming with mighty industrial swathes and vast urban powerhouses. On the oceans stand huge mining platforms, Raia's riches now the United Empire's riches. Above, half-built starship yards orbit the conquered world, as the Empire prepares to take its glorious civilization to the rest of the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetHoratioTitle">Horatio Prime</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetHoratioDescription">Horatio Prime is a world that in most other factions would serve as the vacation planet. Dry, warm, breezy, and beautiful, it is clear from the extensive Endless ruins that more than one spacefaring race has selected it as a preferred destination. Its current infrastructure projects tend to vary with Horatio’s tastes; some buildings blend seamlessly with the landscape while others are garish and metallic statements of architectural extravagance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetTimeLordsTitle">Vanguard</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetTimeLordsDescription">Upon arrival in the galaxy, the Riftborn settled on a snow-covered world that they named Vanguard. Like the rest of the universe they find themselves in, they have little love for the planet, yet in its pristine, white snowfields they find an echo of their own universe, Coroz. Less a home, and more a staging ground for further explorations, the Riftborn inhabit a small corner of the world with order and vigor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetSaharTitle">Sahar</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetSaharDescription">Though Sahar at first appears to be just another dry planet, devoid of anything other than the simplest of life forms, faint geometric patterns that beg to be investigated seem to be etched on its surface. Initial scans indicate that surface ruins do not appear to be related to these patterns. There is clearly a story here of some form of civilization, but nothing remains that can easily be documented from orbit. Only excavation and exploration might potentially reveal what may once have existed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetSykagojaTitle">Sykagoja</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetSykagojaDescription">This lushly forested world was once a major center of the Endless. Oddly, it was a center both of medical research and of entertainment, for it was here that the avian race called the Hissho were first modified to be more effective warriors, and then trained to provide bloodsport spectacles for bored audiences. The wealth brought by the broadcasts was rolled back into the research facilities and some to the Hissho themselves. Who knows how long this media symbiosis might have gone on, had a Virtual attack not destroyed the infrastructure and cut the Hissho free to forge their own destiny.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetVeilTitle">Veil</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetVeilDescription">From orbit this planet is visually uninteresting. Silent and undeveloped, it turns beneath the glare of an indifferent star. History and legend claim it is one of the great centers of Virtual study, however, and the seat of the sub-faction commonly known as the Cabal of Pure Thought. Should these tales be true, the planet would be rich with power generation centers, networks, and a planet-wide infrastructure of super-conducting cables. Until there is a way to render these visible, however, the planet merely appears as it is.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetTeonhaTitle">Teonha</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetTeonhaDescription">The origin planet of the strange race known as the Bhagaba, who are a distributed artificial intelligence whose calculations are done by the random movement of rocks, stones, and even grains of sand on this atoll planet. The warming and cooling of natural ocean currents coupled with tidal shifts and weather turns these elements into a living series of gates and arrays; this in turns transforms the entirety of the planet into a giant computer capable of reason and reflection. The very existence of this planet has caused heated arguments among philosophers and clerics of all stripes, as it is clearly either the work of a supreme being or the irrefutable evidence that one cannot exist.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetMU3R74Title">MU3R74</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetMU3R74Description">From space the planet seems typical of many an advanced civilization's--large-scale infrastructure, dense urban/industrial areas, cultivated wildernesses--except for one anomaly: the complete absence of a comms spectrum at any wavelengths. Planetside, the truth becomes shockingly clear. MU3R74 is a ghost world, terraformed for future inhabitants who never arrived. The corroding shells of Sowers, the self-replicating robotic workers tasked with making planets habitable for the Virtual Endless, litter the world. What befell the Sowers is unclear. Machine plague? Mass suicide? Whatever it is, the outcome looks like a silent apocalypse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetChiarkTitle">Chiark</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetChiarkDescription">Whoever shaped this world into its present form is lost to the sands of time, but it is clear they possessed a mastery of time and space--and games. The whole world is, in fact, the galaxy's most complex game, and players can spend whole lifetimes attempting to master its intricacies. Shrouded in thick mists from the outside, players who "enter" the game find themselves in something akin to a vast living simulation and must rely on all their wits and knowledge to progress. What purpose the game serves is unknown, and whether anybody has ever won is arguable, but what is certain is that the world attracts the galaxy's best minds.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetAcademyTitle">Harrow</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetAcademyDescription">Destroyed in some ancient cataclysm of unknown providence, today all that remains of the original planet is a vast archipelago of stony islands floating in the void of space. Some of these remnants are no bigger than a rock, while others span thousands of klicks, generating their own gravitational fields. All carry whispers of their past. Still held captive by the local star, with each passing millennia these islands spread a little further apart destined to one day appear to be an ordinary asteroid belt, but as long as the fabled Academy remains here, Harrow will never be considered ordinary.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermOpenBordersTitle">Open Borders</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermOpenBordersDescription">This means that the empires open their borders to each other. This will allow ships to move freely through the Systems of both empires and increase Trade and Science.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermCloseBordersTitle">Close Borders</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermCloseBordersDescription">This means that the empires close their borders to each other. Ships will no longer be able to move freely through the other empire's Systems. Trade and Science will decrease.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermPeaceRelationTitle">Peace</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermPeaceRelationDescription">This means that the empires would be at Peace. All hostilities anywhere on the galactic map will cease, and more advanced diplomatic negotiations will be possible.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermForcedPeaceRelationTitle">Force Peace</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermForcedPeaceRelationDescription">This puts the empires into a status of Peace. All hostilities anywhere on the galactic map will cease, and more advanced diplomatic negotiations will be possible.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermTruceRelationTitle">Truce</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermTruceRelationDescription">This means that the empires would enter a Truce. All hostilities anywhere on the galactic map cease, borders will be closed, and declaring war will be more expensive for a while.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermColdWarRelationTitle">Cold War</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermColdWarRelationDescription">This means that the empires would be at Cold War. Ships of the other empire may be attacked on neutral territory or if they invade your territory without declaring War.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermWarRelationTitle">War</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermWarRelationDescription">This means that the empires would be at War. This is automatic if ships are attacked inside their home Systems. No treaty is possible except Truce from this status.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermAllianceRelationTitle">Alliance</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermAllianceRelationDescription">This means that the empires would join an Alliance. Alliances automatically share galactic map and ship vision data. If there is a Close Borders treaty it is automatically nullified. Advanced diplomatic negotiations are possible.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermTechnologyDealTitle">Technology Transfer</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermTechnologyDealDescription">You propose that there is a transfer of scientific knowledge.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermResourceDealTitle">Resource Exchange</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermBreakAllianceTitle">Leave Alliance</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermBreakAllianceDescription">This is a request to leave their existing Alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermProposeAllianceRelationTitle">Propose Alliance</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermProposeAllianceRelationDescription">This is a request to create an Alliance with another empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermProposePeaceRelationTitle">Propose Peace</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermProposePeaceRelationDescription">This is a request to sign a Peace treaty with another empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermDeclareWarTitle">Declare War</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermDeclareWarDescription">This is a statement that you are going to war with another empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermDeclareWarDemandTitle">Declare War</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermDeclareWarDemandDescription">This is a statement that you are going to war on another empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermVisionSharingTitle">Vision Sharing</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermVisionSharingDescription">This is a request to share the Ship, System and Probe Vision with another empire (you will see what they see on the galaxy view).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermCancelVisionSharingTitle">Cancel Vision Sharing</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermCancelVisionSharingDescription">This is a unilateral declaration to stop a Vision Sharing agreement with another empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermMapSharingTitle">Map Sharing</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermMapSharingDescription">This is a request to share the known galactic map with another empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermTradeAgreementTitle">Trade Agreement</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermTradeAgreementDescription">If signed, a Trade Agreement will trace routes between all your HQs and the other player's Subsidiaries, and vice versa. Trade Routes cannot cross enemy systems and can be interrupted by war, blockades, etc.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermCancelTradeAgreementTitle">Cancel Trade Agreement</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermCancelTradeAgreementDescription">This is a unilateral declaration to stop a Trade Agreement with another empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermScienceAgreementTitle">Science Agreement</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermScienceAgreementDescription">Both you and the other player gain an incremental boost to your research; the longer the Science agreement lasts, the better the boost.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermCancelScienceAgreementTitle">Cancel Science Agreement</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermCancelScienceAgreementDescription">This is a unilateral declaration to stop a Science Agreement with another empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermPressureReductionTitle">Pressure Reduction</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermPressureReductionDescription">This is a proposal to remove the diplomatic and territorial pressure on another empire in exchange for something.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermPressureReductionDemandTitle">Pressure Cessation</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermPressureReductionDemandDescription">This is a demand to remove the diplomatic and territorial pressure on another empire in exchange for something.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermIntroduceYourselfTitle">Introduce Yourself</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermIntroduceYourselfDescription">This is to present yourself to another empire who you have discovered, but who themselves are currently unaware of you. It will unlock new diplomatic options.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermProposeColdWarRelationDemandTitle">Break Peace Treaty with {0}</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermProposeColdWarRelationDemandDescription">This is to force this empire to break their existing Peace with another empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermProposeCancelScienceAgreementDemandTitle">Break Science Agreement with {0}</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermProposeCancelScienceAgreementDemandDescription">This is to force this empire to break their existing Science Agreement with another empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermProposeCancelTradeAgreementDemandTitle">Break Trade Agreement with {0}</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermProposeCancelTradeAgreementDemandDescription">This is to force this empire to break their existing Trade Agreement with another empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermGeneratePressureTitle">Bureaucratic obstacles</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticTermGeneratePressureDescription">Through a deluge of formal diplomatic requests and actions, you manage to clutter diplomatic channels with this empire and increase your pressure on him.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%QuestVictoryObjectiveScore_Step1_Objective1Title">Score Victory</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%QuestVictoryObjectiveMilitary_Step1_Objective1Title">Military Victory</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToArcticTitle">Terraform To Arctic</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToArcticDescription">While cold is amply available in the 0 Kelvin vacuum of space, the process of applying the correct amount of cold while hydrating a planet is not a simple operation. Atmospheric engineering and an advanced knowledge of water chemistry is needed to complete the process successfully.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToDesertTitle">Terraform To Desert</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToDesertDescription">Though the climate may be hostile, a desert planet can be rich in valuable resources. "Upgrading" from an even less hospitable planet is still a major task, requiring the creation of atmosphere, some basic level of soils and hydration, and even simple life forms.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToSnowTitle">Terraform To Snow</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToSnowDescription">Arbitrarily differentiated from "Arctic" by a galactic index indicating probability and richness of native life, terraforming to Snow is primarily a question of generating greater seasonal fluctuation and seeding the planet with simple life forms adapted to the cold, wet environment.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToSteppesTitle">Terraform To Steppes</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToSteppesDescription">Though cool and dry, Steppes planets can support plant and animal life, even in massive forms like auroch or wolf. Warming the planet through manipulation of the atmosphere is the other key change that needs to be successfully handled by terraforming.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToVeldtTitle">Terraform To Savannah</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToVeldtDescription">Relatively dry and relatively warm, Savannah planets can nevertheless support a wide variety of plant and animal life. Seeding these life forms and regulating the atmosphere to an acceptable level are the key changes required to terraform.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToAridTitle">Terraform To Arid</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToAridDescription">Typically done to elevate a less hospitable planet type to Arid, this project requires the creation of viable soils and a functioning, if relatively dry, atmosphere. It is still an enormous investment in energy, raw materials, and time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToBorealTitle">Terraform To Boreal</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToBorealDescription">Teeming with animal life and vegetation in spite of its relative cold, terraformation into a Boreal-type planet requires introduction of a wide range of species and a soil sufficiently rich to serve as the base of the ecosystem.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToJungleTitle">Terraform To Jungle</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToJungleDescription">Changing any planet type into a world as rich and vibrant as a jungle requires time, dedication, and extremely sophisticated bioengineering. A masterpiece of applied genetics, artificial evolution, and resource utilization, this transformation is only available to the most advanced societies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToMonsoonTitle">Terraform To Monsoon</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToMonsoonDescription">Primarily famous for the dampness of the atmosphere and the relatively fierce storms, Monsoon-type planets require terraforming that involves hydration on a massive scale as well as balanced temperatures.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToTerranTitle">Terraform To Terran</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToTerranDescription">Rich and varied, a Terran-class planet is one of the most viable and valuable planet types in the universe. Transforming another planet into this type is necessarily an expensive and scientifically complex task. But, like most things in life, it wouldn't be interesting if it were too easy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToOceanTitle">Terraform To Ocean</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToOceanDescription">Water. An atom of oxygen bound to two simple hydrogens; something minimal and simple but necessary on the scale of a few trillion cubic kilometers to create an ocean world. While the result is a planet potentially wealthy in life and resources, it is not a project for the faint of heart.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToAtollTitle">Terraform To Atoll</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToAtollDescription">Picturesque due to the islands and sea, these planets require a relatively rich marine environment and a relatively simple land environment. Terraforming therefore revolves around temperature, ocean life, and undersea mountains.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToForestTitle">Terraform To Forest</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToForestDescription">Moisture and in particular a deep and rich soil base are required for these terraformation efforts. A temperate atmosphere and relatively high precipitation are not enough if the dirt itself lacks the nutrients.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToLavaTitle">Terraform To Lava</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToLavaDescription">Through the use of effective (if clumsy) streams of gravitons, planetary cores can be liquefied and the basics of plate tectonics imposed on a planetoid. This effectively turns the planetary body into a seething cauldron that creates high-value minerals; it may somewhat reduce its value for tourism.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToAshTitle">Terraform To Ash</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToAshDescription">Terraforming a planet into ash requires imitating the affect of the millennia of volcanic activity required to deposit the layers of ash. Typically space debris and fusion heat are required to produce the necessary effect.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToBarrenTitle">Terraform To Barren</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToBarrenDescription">A planet described as "barren" is generally devoid of air, water, and anything else that makes it habitable. Though this sounds unpleasant, certain peoples find these planets ideal for their needs.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToIceTitle">Terraform To Ice</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToIceDescription">The delicate issue with this terraformation is to remove enough atmosphere to drop the temperature without losing the moisture. When this is achieved, however, life on a chilly, lifeless ball is possible.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToSwampTitle">Terraform To Toxic</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToSwampDescription">Sterilization of a living planet is a fairly direct process; radiation and poisons are both easy to come by and simple to administer. Before you start, however, be sure that the end product is really what you want.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToTundraTitle">Terraform To Tundra</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToTundraDescription">Terraforming a planet into a Tundra-type requires sophisticated manipulation of temperature and humidity on a planetary scale. This requires precise thermodynamic control and a great deal of energy, neither of which would be possible without the use of exotic matter.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToTropicalTitle">Terraform To Mediterranean</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationToTropicalDescription">Though rich in water, these planets are dry and hot. Terraforming efforts target atmospheric temperatures that are consistently high and soil that is not necessarily very rich.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationFromBarrenToForestTitle">Terraform To Forest</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationFromBarrenToForestDescription">This is an epic effort, to take a Barren planet and give it the soil, atmosphere, water, and weather systems to make plant life thrive. On top of that, tree species must be discovered or engineered that can survive in this newly generated environment.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationFromArcticToForestTitle">Terraform To Forest</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationFromArcticToForestDescription">While there is some water, there is still a great deal of work to take an Arctic planet and transform it into a Forest. Planetary warming, soil bacteria, and the life forms of a rich biosphere all have to be brought to this hostile terrain.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationFromSnowToForestTitle">Terraform To Forest</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationFromSnowToForestDescription">The major challenges in this conversion are temperature and biodiversity. Water at least is plentiful, though to change it from permanent frost to rain is still a non-negligible effort.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationFromLavaToForestTitle">Terraform To Forest</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationFromLavaToForestDescription">The advantage of a Lava planet is that it may have a base of cooled magma that could potentially provide rich soil. It is still a difficult uphill battle to stabilize the crust, cool and filter the atmosphere, and generate enough water to support a planet-wide forest.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationFromAshToForestTitle">Terraform To Forest</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationFromAshToForestDescription">Though there is a potential soil base from the Ash, the massive challenge of hydrating and cooling the planet enough to maintain a hydrological cycle make this project a difficult challenge.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationFromDesertToForestTitle">Terraform To Forest</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetTerraformationFromDesertToForestDescription">Less difficult than other possible starting points, this terraformation project nevertheless faces the challenge of hydrating and cooling the planet, as well as adapting native species to live in an arboreal environment--or replacing them and starting all over with the plant/animal ecosphere.</LocalizationPair>
