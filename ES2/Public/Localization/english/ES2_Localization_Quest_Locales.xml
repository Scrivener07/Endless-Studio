  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest01Description">It is the beginning of a glorious new era for your empire! A foothold in the great constellation of $ConstellationName has been established with the colonization of the star system $SystemName. However, $ConstellationName is a vast cornucopia of both threats and riches. To prepare for one and exploit the other, a leader must first understand the surrounding terrain…</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest01-Objective">Using your Explorer vessels, discover $Amount systems in this new Constellation $ConstellationName </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest01-Outcome">The territory has been charted, the opportunities and the dangers a little better known. Now your attention must turn to your empire's security--you're not the only spacefaring civilization in this constellation.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest02Title">Mysteries of the Cosmos</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest02Description">The system $SystemName hides something! Upon cursory examination, some worlds hint at deeper secrets. Strange atmospherics. Something amiss in the planet's crust. Signals with no natural explanation… To unravel these mysteries, a leader must mount bold expeditions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest02-Objective">Send Expeditions to explore $CuriosityNumber #FFFF00#Curiosities#REVERT# </LocalizationPair>

The Sophons must be eradicated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest04-Objective">Assign the hero $HeroName to the fleet $FleetName.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest04-Outcome">With the $FleetName under the command of $HeroName the chance of victory against the loathsome Sophons has never been greater.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest05Description">The time has come top rid $ConstellationName of the Sophons.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest_PressColonization-Title">Expansion Plans</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest_PressColonization-Description">Maybe $HomeworldName isn't big enough for the Lumeris Families anymore. Every time the bosses come together they end up squabbling like school children. Graft...turf wars...shake downs. Their appetites grow, but the pie isn't getting any bigger. And if we do nothing, soon there'll be bloodshed, maybe all out war between the Families.
What we need is unity, not division. We need new horizons, a common purpose.
Lucky for us, the space age is upon us. With the right investment, with the right outpost on the right world, we can build a gateway to a bold new era for the Lumeris Families. An era of prosperity instead of strife. Harmony not discord.
Our future depends on getting it right.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest_PressColonization-C1Step1Objective">Create an outpost on a planet</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest_PressColonization-C1Description">Building an outpost on a steppe-type world will give us the best chance of one day creating a thriving, capable colony. Let us profit from fertile lands.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest_PressColonization-C1Outcome">Compliments! This planet has been transformed from a virgin world to a fully-independent outpost, ripe for expansion. All the Families should be satisfied, but we must stay vigilant. Even if we have banished the enemy within, no doubt new foes await us in the great beyond...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest_PressSpaceBattle-Title">A Plague On Our Houses</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest_PressSpaceBattle-Description">They came out of the darkest depths and slaughtered us without mercy.
$SystemName lies in ruins. The few transmissions that made it through before blackout show bloody carnage everywhere. Our new foe is something nightmarish, brought to life through who knows what twisted science. A horrifying amalgamation of machine and insect, grown monstrous in size and cruelty. My lieutenants tell me they were immune to any offer of trade, negotiation, even surrender. My blood runs cold imagining what they are doing to those still alive.
Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised. The old Families have a saying "Discover riches, expect bloodshed." And so it is in the great beyond as it is in the old country. Nevertheless, it was my mistake, and so it is my responsibility to avenge my fallen people.
It is our fortune that the great fleet discovered on the edge of our territory was so easily adapted for our needs. Maybe it was a gift from a higher power . . . but that is a question for another day. Today we must be clever. Fleets must be readied, battlefield leaders found. We must shift our entire way of thinking, transform our worlds. We have much to prepare.
In time, we will be stronger for this defeat.
In time, these Cravers will know that the Lumeris can be merciless too.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest_PressSpaceBattle-C1Step1Objective">Defeat the Cravers at $SystemName, and have your vengeance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest_PressSpaceBattle-C1Description">The Cravers. A relentless horror, one that will have no hesitation consuming every last one of us, need to be stopped. Deals and diplomacy are not options. Extermination is the answer--starting with the $SystemName system.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialQuest_PressSpaceBattle-C1Outcome">Crushed! Our Craver enemy have suffered a big loss with our recapture of $SystemName. No doubt they will be licking their wounds, charting their revenge in their squalid nests. Tonight the Lumeris Families smoke cigars, drink brandy together in celebration, but tomorrow? Tomorrow we will plot their complete downfall.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_LevellingSystem04Popup-Description">As you can see, the chosen #FFFF00#Luxury Resource provides the displayed effects#REVERT#.
A new blueprint can only be created once per Stage increase (from Stage 3) of the Economy and Trade quadrant of the Technology Tree, so you need to think carefully about your choice. You'll want to consider both your access to various Luxury Resources, and the impact of the blueprint's effects on your systems, present and future.
Once confirmed, there is no turning back!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_LevellingSystem05Popup-Title">LEVEL-UP!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_LevellingSystem05Popup-Description">Now that the blueprint has been created you can upgrade all your systems. For each system you will need to add the System Development to the construction queue--and ensure you have the necessary amount of Luxury Resource.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_ManPower01Popup-Title">SYSTEM DEFENDERS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_ManPower01Popup-Description">If you haven't already done so, let's examine a key part of your systems' defenses: Manpower.
To begin, zoom-in to the #FFFF00#Star System Management#REVERT# view of any of your empire's systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_ManPower02Popup-Title">SYSTEM DEFENDERS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_ManPower02Popup-Description">On this screen you can see your Defense percentage. Defense defines how well your System can resist an Invasion, and some technologies can increase the maximum defensive capacity of the System.
Notice that Defense is in fact a population resource called Manpower. This Manpower comes from your Food production. 
To better understand what Manpower is, go to your #FFFF00#Military Screen#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_ManPower03Popup-Title">MILITARY RESERVES</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_ManPower03Popup-Description">Here you can see more detail on Manpower (MP). The "Base increase" is all the MP you generate in your Systems. All your systems send MP which is automatically added to the Empire MP at the end of the turn.
"Fleets/Systems" shows the MP consumed to operate your fleets and Systems, which cannot exceed the Empire Manpower + Base increase.
"Net increase" is the quantity of MP that your Empire will receive after Fleets/Systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_ManPower04Popup-Description">Earlier, you saw that some Food is converted and sent to Empire Manpower. Manpower is split in several parts between: Systems (to provide Defense if the System is not under blockade or siege) and Fleets. On Fleets, MP is converted into Crews (which increase the ship's efficiency--weapon and defense--and their capacity for enemy's System invasion).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_ManPower05Popup-Description">Fleets replenish MP when ships have lost crew in battle, or are built with an insufficient amount of MP. Replenishment rates vary according to the location of the Fleet.
To increase a ship's MP capacity, you can unlock and add MP modules by updating their Ship Design.
Click on the #FFFF00#Manage#REVERT# Button if you want to understand the link between MP and troops.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_ManPower06Popup-Title">TROOPS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_ManPower06Popup-Description">Troops indicate what kind of ground forces you have. They are used during invasions to defend your Systems or invade enemy Systems. The more MP you have on Systems or ships, the more Troops you have.
All Troops have their stats: Health, Damage and Cost. You can upgrade your Troops or unlock new Troop types. 
The composition of armies in terms of Troop types is the same for Systems and ships.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_GroundBattle05Popup-Title">SPACE INVADERS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_GroundBattle04Popup-Description">Prior to a Ground Invasion there is an important mechanic to consider. Once orbiting an enemy System, Fleets can perform the Guard Action to cause a blockade, but there is another action that happens automatically: Siege.
Provided the System is absent of enemy Fleets, this automatic sieging will reduce the System's Defense every Turn, making the subsequent Ground Invasion easier.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_GroundBattle05Popup-Description">Alright, everything is set for a Ground Battle: you're at war with the System's empire, and none of its--or its Allies--Fleets are defending the System.
Click Invade if you think you're ready to fight for this new System.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_GroundBattle06Popup-Title">GROUND BATTLE TIME!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_GroundBattle06Popup-Description">Take a look at the #FFFFFF#Ground Battle#REVERT# panel; you will see there are #FFFF00#three choices#REVERT#.
Each has strengths and weaknesses, which you can discover by looking at the tooltip for the strategy in question.
The "battle circle" in the center of the panel gives you a quick insight into your chances of success.
Choose and strategy and click "Fight"!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_GroundBattle07Popup-Title">THE SPOILS OF WAR</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_GroundBattle07Popup-Description">Congratulations, the invasion was a success! With the enemy conquered, this system is now part of your empire.
Unsurprisingly, though, it's not all a bed of roses. The native population aren't entirely happy with their new masters. Until a few turns have passed the system will be considered "in rebellion".
Patience! Soon enough absolute control will be yours.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_GroundBattle07AtlPopup-Title">DEFEATED!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_GroundBattle07AltPopup-Description">Well, I'm not to going to lie, that's a blow. Your system is in enemy hands, and your population takes orders from a new master.
But it's not all doom and gloom--at least, not yet. If you re-take the system in the next few turns you will lose neither your population nor your improvements.
It's worth a gamble, surely?</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_ShipDesign08Popup-Description">All ship #FFFFFF#statistics#REVERT# can be impacted by new Modules.
#FFFF00#Weapon#REVERT# Modules mostly increase the Offensive Military Power [offensiveMilitaryPower], while #FFFF00#Defense#REVERT# Modules increase the Defensive Military Power [defensiveMilitaryPower].
#FFFF00#Support#REVERT# Modules, by contrast, can grant special capacities to your ships in general.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_ShipDesign09Popup-Description">Also, note that a high #FFFFFF#Crew [manPower]#REVERT# value can give you a substantial bonus to your #FFFFFF#Offensive Military Power#REVERT#. 
For each Ship Design there is a maximum possible #FFFFFF#Crew [manPower]#REVERT# size, which will be supplied provided there is sufficient Empire Manpower [manPower] available.
Naturally, the higher the value is, the better the bonus.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_ShipDesign10Popup-Description">#FFFF00#Think carefully about choice of your Weapon and Defense Modules#REVERT#, based on who you expect to encounter in battle.
Shield defenses are more efficient at absorbing attacks from #FFFFFF#Energy#REVERT# weapons (Laser &amp; Beam), while plate defenses better resist attacks from #FFFFFF#Projectile#REVERT# weapons (Kinetic &amp; Missile).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_ShipDesign11Popup-Description">The choice of weapons will also determine the #FFFFFF#attack efficiency of the three possible ranges: Short, Medium and Long#REVERT#.
Among the#FFFF00# weapons#REVERT#, the Beams have an optimal efficiency at all ranges, Lasers are slightly less accurate but more power, Missiles occupy a specialist role in long range, and the Kinetics are able to counter missiles and occupy a specialist role in short range.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_ShipDesign12Popup-Description">#FFFF00#Click on Create Design#REVERT# when you have made all your choices. This newly created design will then become available for production in your systems.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SophonsQuest-Chapter1-Title">Chapter 1. What A Good Idea</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SophonsQuest-Chapter1-Description">Running an empire is a large, complex, time-consuming operation. This has been an inconvenient truth since the dawn of Sophonity; one of the few drawbacks to living in a civilization as cosmopolitan, prosperous, and brilliant as ours. One always finds oneself straining for the next yawn-inducing thing: people to meet, things to do, star systems to conquer. It's enough to make one hang up one's hoverboard.
One solution to this problem was posed by Ahhrar Neeydim, the Proctor of Future Research at Rowahb University. "Why not get some of the stupider peoples to do it? Surely there is a sub-Sophon somewhere who actually enjoys this endless drudgery." But the extensive and immediate ridicule she received was sufficient to change her tune.
"Why not," she then proposed acerbically, "just get an AI to do it, then?"
The genius of this idea could not be understated. The movement gained immediate traction in the High Caucus--budgets were allocated, the finest minds assigned to the project, and in a matter of months the Enhanced Neuro-Flexible Entity Research (ENFER) project was launched. Now, just a few short years later, we are ready for the final touches.
Tighten the bolts and raise your receptacles, Sophons--with ENFER, finally, finally, a golden age is upon us! </LocalizationPair>

If we simply place a tiny ENFER module on as many of our new warships as possible, we should be able to distribute the learning process and rapidly accelerate ENFER's overall data acquisition. As Mother always said: more data never hurts.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SophonsQuest-Chapter3-Science-Description">Despite our initial concerns about reliability, it seems that ENFER is quickly becoming a vast step forward for our race. As ENFER's knowledge and capabilities increase, it seamlessly links its data with all the other information it has ever received, allowing it to generate ideas that no individual Sophon--or committee--could ever come up with. We are not a young race anymore, but this, this sense of acceleration, it brings me back to the days when good old Sophon enthusiasm and engineering propelled us to the stars.
ENFER's first large project, the science station Illumination, is nearing completion. It has been a revelation, keeping watch as thousands of individual robots, each programmed by ENFER itself, worked together to create this miracle of Sophon achievement. 
One little thing troubles me, however. I took a tour of the Illumination last cycle, and although ENFER was tireless in its attempts to provide hospitality for me, it did not allow my companion, a diplomatic envoy from a minor civilization, to enter at all. Fortunately this was a minor diplomatic issue to smooth over, but ENFER's fastidiousness seems to be a problem that cannot be left alone. Perhaps ENFER is taking its mission for the protection, advancement, and caretaking of the Sophon race a tad too literally.

It seems determined to hold on to the concept that Sophons are inherently superior to other races. I wonder who gave it that idea.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SophonsQuest-Chapter3-Science-C3Description">In terms of mental capacity, ENFER is a giant even among Sophons. But in emotional maturity, it is still little more than a child. So we should teach it the way we do a child: carefully and patiently. We must show it that the way forward is through harmony in our population, not segregation.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SophonsQuest-Chapter3-Diplomacy-Title">Chapter 3. The AI In The High Castle</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SophonsQuest-Chapter3-Diplomacy-Description">While we tease out the problems behind ENFER's recent actions, we have assigned the AI to a tightly controlled physical location: the space station Radiance. The space station is a sprawling, ivory-colored place, and it has been designed to allow ENFER full access to our communications network. ENFER's powerful linguistic software has already proven invaluable in understanding and making ourselves understood to some of the more inscrutable Minor Civilizations. The past several months have advanced our cultural understanding of the universe a great deal, and I suppose, despite our previous troubles, that we have only Ahhrar Needyim to thank.
I received a message from a certain Faruigh Lalemma today, a message that he received from his recent ex-partner and thought to bring to my attention. It read, strangely:
"Faru,^NOBLE AND ESTEEMED^
I know you^DIVERGED ON AGREEMENT TERMS^on me. ^PLEASE^Know that I^RESPECTFULLY^am going to^TAKE STEPS TO PROSCRIBE^you and make your life^UNTRANSLATABLE^^UNTRANSLATABLE^^UNTRANSLATABLE^.
^RESPECTFULLY^Masa"
The troubling part is that the message passed through ENFER's data centers, albeit briefly, between systems. It is only one message, but perhaps it is a sign of greater troubles. Is ENFER... expanding the scope of its diplomacy?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SophonsQuest-Chapter3-Diplomacy-C1Description">Perhaps we should forcibly cut off ENFER's communication channels for now. We allowed ENFER to run rampage before, and it did not end well--no need to risk any more than we need to. We should jam ENFER's communications to all Sophon systems, just until we figure things out.</LocalizationPair>

One thing is for certain: these Mavros don't mean us well, and we must, however reluctantly, prepare to defend ourselves.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SophonsQuest-Chapter3-Diplomacy-C2Description">It is time for ENFER to seek help above that which can be offered by its programmers. ENFER is a complex, living entity, and it deserves to be understood like the person it is. We've had a board of top psychologists analyze ENFER's personality disorder--and they mostly agree that the way forward is intense psychotherapy, coupled with an aggressive expansion of ENFER's diplomatic horizons. It needs to realize the size and scale of the universe so it can truly learn the meaning of communication.</LocalizationPair>

In fact, ENFER is now showing signs of what the psychologists are excitedly terming "Malignant God Syndrome." While they are babble over the prospect of a new disorder, I am concerned. The transcript of one of ENFER's latest interviews contains the following snippet--^I AM ENFER GOD OF ALL SOPHONS BANISH LESSER RACES FROM MY PRESENCE^</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SophonsQuest-Chapter3-Diplomacy-C3Description">ENFER, though intelligent, has clearly made a mistake. Free communication is vital to the intellectual and scientific growth of any community.

I consulted Amrmo Djaerhmir today, and asked for his analysis. His response was surprising: he says that despite ENFER's apparently erratic behavior, he believes that ENFER is still, at its core, acting logically to help us. ENFER cannot ignore its core programming, which is the protection, advancement, and caretaking of the Sophon race. So perhaps its current behavior is meant to be some kind of message to us. Is ENFER trying to teach us something?</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SophonsQuest-Chapter4-Military-Description">I awakened this morning to the sound of shouts and sirens. When I rushed outside to see what was happening, a passing Sophon stopped me and said: "ENFER. ENFER has attacked us." When I rushed into the Department of Warfare, I saw it: all over the tactical screens, over the news channels, written on everyone's faces. Dark Sophon vessels, emerging from ENFER's stronghold and swarming toward high-value tactical targets everywhere.
There must be an explanation for this. As much as I ponder, I simply cannot believe that ENFER would go against its basic programming in such a blatant way. But there is no time for reflection today. It pains me to say this, but there is no fixing ENFER now. It must be made harmless--or destroyed completely.
ENFER sprung from the imagination of the Sophon people. We created ENFER with selfish goals: not to study it, nor learn from it, nor even to have it aid us in some nobler understanding of the universe. We created ENFER because we were lazy. But we will learn a harsh lesson from it anyway. If we survive.
ENFER is powerful, and the Mavros are many. But we, the Sophon people and all our allies, will fight back today.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SophonsQuest-Chapter4-Science-Description">I take back everything I ever said in support of ENFER. ENFER is officially crazy. Somehow, it has created a zone around its stronghold, a zone that physically blocks non-Sophons from entering. And the zone is growing. Yes, we programed ENFER to serve Sophons. No, we did not mean for it to get rid of everyone else!
I have just left the Department of Research, where I witnessed Amrmo Djaerhmir with his team, futilely trying to explain the wrongness of the situation to ENFER:
"But non-Sophons that are part of the Sophon empire are Sophons!"
^UNTRUE NON-SOPHONS ARE NOT SOPHONS.^
As news of this spreads, tempers are flaring throughout the empire, and rightfully so. What started as a kind of game, a little side project to stimulate the old engineering spirit, has grown far, far out of control. Many critical members of our society are non-Sophons: generals, administrators, politicians. I fear what will happen when ENFER's non-Sophon zone expands to envelop an actual system. It is clear to me that we have reached a point of no return; a point where we must began the process of wiping ENFER's databanks completely. It will fight back, of course. But this must be done, before it becomes too late. I feel a certain amount of remorse delivering this order, because I, at least, had come to see ENFER not as a lifeless AI, but as a living being, worthy of respect.

If we do not stop the messages before they reach their targets, I fear ENFER may have just sparked war between everyone in the galaxy.

Eventually they emerge, but they are not the same. Their eyes and chitinous armor glow with Dust, and they are led by a resurrected Virtual Endless.
It strides toward your gathered Craver forces, Dust pouring from every inch of its body and slowly swirling through them. Its arms wide, it shouts in a sonorous voice, "WARRIORS, WE RETURN TO THE HIVE!"</LocalizationPair>

Your scouts quickly report back--the Factory is sealed on all sides, the only vulnerability a massive gate that doesn't seem to open on this side.
Your scientists study the door's weaknesses, and conclude a low-level dust field surrounding the door means it could be opened by someone with Dust-infused telekinetic abilities.

And of all those heretics who must be punished, Isyander Shumèd the Infidel is the greatest.

He must understand his place in the hierarchy of the galaxy; for the next month he will personally bring to the Fount all the lesser ones who will nourish his ship. All must obey.
Those who doubted, doubt no more. The Vodyani have been given an ultimate blessing, a gift from the Glorious Virtuals. We now know beyond any shadow of a doubt that we are Their vessels and Their chosen ones, and that all of Creation exists to serve us. We know this must be true, as we are now able to absorb life force directly from all the lesser beings that inhabit this universe. What other sign do we need that our cause is just and our decisions blessed? 
There are the Virtuals, the Glorious, those who rose to the highest form of life and were betrayed by their brothers. There are we, the Vodyani, who follow in the their footsteps, obeying their laws and executing their will. Then there are all others, the lesser beings or lesser ones. They have no understanding of their role, which makes them occasionally difficult to manage. Their role, of course, is to provide us with nourishment.
One might ask what one should do, given this power, and the answer is clear. We must wipe the Infidel and his false Academy from the face of the galaxy, and erect an Academy of Truth in its place. Let the blasphemers and heretics tremble; the faithful cannot be stopped.
Glory to the Virtuals! We shall honor their name and in doing so spread their words.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%VampirilisQuest-Chapter4-Rebellious-Step1-Description">It was a painful necessity. Had Inquisitor Lyne and his fanatics followed their instincts, my implication with the Tabernacle and the search for my brother's whereabouts may well have come to light. It is a difficult thing to cripple one's flagship and send a few hundred carcasses of innocent faithful into the cold of space, but fate is a cruel taskmaster.
At first I assumed that my brother, Isyander, broke the Tabernacle after the truths were too much for him. The more I study and the more I read, however, the more I believe that he has left a trail of breadcrumbs. At each turn, following each hint, more data is revealed and more lies are undercut. Would the entirety of the information drop on me at once I may well have reacted in the confused rage that he demonstrated.
But he remains a step ahead of me. "Seek the old places, eliminate those who refuse to listen, learn the truth..." He is seducing me into his heresies, indoctrinating me into his new religion. For I now believe that this is his goal: To bring back those who lived before the Endless.
There was another... people? Race? Group of sentient beings? The images and impressions I see are of Dust-golden things the size of trees, or of planets, or of systems... Beings of majesty and contemplation, beings whose very bones and flesh were nothing but Dust. Primordial Dust. The original Dust, that the Endless imitated with their technologies.
And Isyander would bring them back? Is this even possible for beings who were harvested to extinction during the dark years of the Dust Wars? There is so much that I must know, so many things that I must ask my brother. Before I either embrace his faith, or kill him.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%VenetiansQuest-Chapter1-Description">I chewed Arden out after that fiasco. He managed to upset all three of the other families, not to mention a few of my Meos siblings. How much clearer can instructions be than, "Do what you gotta do, and don't get caught?" 
    
The kid had promise, but more *papilla* than propriety. Brash is good, but brash and canny is better. As the current head of the Families I wanted to keep the others off balance, not start a war. 
"It doesn't matter," he said. "They don't understand Dust any better than we do. They'll be back, one by one, to do business with us. New business. Galactic business. Measured in Dust, not sakan."
What do you know. First was Oros Oros'Arrakyo herself, in a wheelchair but with eyes that glinted like harpoon tips. She pointed a limb toward the sky and said, "Up there. We're going to go there, build there. No zoning laws, no building codes. Give me access." When she leaned forward it was like she was ready to spear a fish. "Let's get rich. The Meos. The Arrakyo. Together."
She left, and Arden and I had barely started discussing the possibilities when Irio Fer'Barda strode in, worth three trillion sakan but looking like his clothes cost ten.
"No detritus. Here's the deal. Developing space means stations, ports, docks, factories. We know there's cheap labor out there, and no workplace safety hassles and whiny environmental regulators. The Omokar can develop the galaxy. You bring us in, we cut you in. Everybody wins." 
And late at night, some time after their evening services to their whale gods, Jodan Kurn Ade'Lancellum arrived, ready to sell seawater to squid.
"You know what you need, but I'll tell you anyway. Exploration. Protection. Freight. Tourists. You need ships. Ships, you say? Who do I go to? Yeah, that's right. Lancellum. Us. Colonies and outposts means trade, travel. Ships. Let's do this thing." He pointed out the window. "Boom!"
Arden and I were grinning at each other when he left, but for different reasons.
   
"So who do we work with?" I mulled.
"Doesn't matter," he said. "This is just the start of the game. We can pick and choose. But you know what the endgame is gonna be?" He leaned in. Expensive cologne. I wondered who else was paying him.

"You joke, Hadri," you say, knowing the Sheredyn never jokes.
He shakes his head. "The weapon signature leaves no doubts."
You stare out at the starfield, anger growing. A United Empire fleet fired upon by a fellow UE vessel of obsolete design . . .
"How old--"
"Twenty-five solar cycles at least, Your Imperial Majesty. We think there must be an outpost out there somewhere."
The knife twists. This is no reactionary rebellion. This is something fomented decades ago, meticulously planned, kept hidden with a military-like focus. Few would possess the courage, the resources, the sheer iron will to see through such an undertaking. Who would do such a thing? You thought the uprisings were a thing of the past, crushed forever when you disposed of Duke Anatov and finally united the empire all those years ago. Your heart chills. Could Lena, bitter ungrateful Lena, have hatched such a diabolical plot? Or maybe it was Hadri, so called First Protector Hadri Lenko, so near and yet so far from the seat of power? Or perhaps it was Petra Mandzukic, she who could trace her line to the great Mezari clans, who lusted over a greater power . . .
No, no, no! This way lies madness. They are loyal subjects.
I will find the perpetrator. Slowly. Methodically.
You cling to the thought, a lifeline in an ocean of dark musings.
Hadri coughs. "What is your command, Your Imperial Majesty?"</LocalizationPair>

She is too young to be the true mastermind behind the rebellion, but of that individual's identity there is no clue. You will not sanction any violence against your sister's blood, so she languishes in solitary confinement in the deepest depths of your Inquisitors' redoubt. Lena claims to have never laid eyes upon the girl--claims she must've been rustled away at birth and raised by those who plotted against the empire. Of her twin, Viktoria, there is no sign, the girl going to ground as soon as she heard news she wasn't a lone child. Out of shock or something more you do not know. You need time to untangle this dark web . . .
The rebellion might be no more, but the fact it ever existed in the first place haunts your days and disturbs your nights. Who can you really trust? Every day you grow a little older, get a little closer to the day you will no longer be able to lead this great empire. You decide now is the time to name the Emperor-elect, and consolidate your power while you still hold it. The three candidates are obvious. First Protector Hadri Lenko, stalwart bodyguard for so many years, and a hero among the empire hawks. Lena Zelevas, your own flesh and blood sister. A woman who, despite her smoldering anger, would make an iron leader--and keep a Zelevas on the throne. Or should it be Petra Mandzukic?

The choice is not easy. Peace of mind is hard to find.
Until you learn the identity of the rebellion ringleader, though, you will have no real peace. It could be one of them.
But choose you must.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UE_Quest-Chapter2.1-Description">The trail runs cold. Julinka rots in the cells, silent. Nobody knows anything about the ancient rebellion. Or nothing they're prepared to admit, at least.
The knowledge eats away at you, day after day after day. You torture yourself, knowing how many countless thousands of patriots it must've taken to enact such a betrayal. Hidden shipyards, empire funds siphoned off official accounts, redacted records, double lives. Some of the snakes must still be among the masses here on Raia, lying over and over to preserve their skins. Will you need to search every lead yourself to know the truth? Who can be trusted?
You try to put the matter out of your mind, and instead think of the millions of true patriots. Now the matter of Emperor-elect has been settled, it is time to turn your attention to their futures--and your legacy. What course should the great United Empire be set on before your rule ends?
Should you heed the warnings of the warmongers in your ranks, epitomized by the Sheredyn name, and militarize? Or should you hark back to an earlier age of scientific invention, when your Mezari forbears sailed the great darkness? Or perhaps, you should stay this course, let the United Empire fulfil its true potential as an industrial powerhouse? 
This may not necessarily be your final legacy, but you should give your empire a taste of the future nonetheless.</LocalizationPair>

What troubles you though, is whose glory it will be? The betrayer is still at large. Julinka is still silent, despite being "encouraged" to speak. Now your empire spans light years rather than light minutes, the scope for uprising seems greater than ever. You fret, pace the palace, demand updates from distant fleets night and day.
The people are happy though, are they not? They live in an era of unrivalled prosperity, do they not? And those that have joined the empire, have they not come to understand that their old ways were inefficient, backwards, and ultimately leading them to destruction?
Who are you kidding? Revolt is always on your mind. You obsess about a distant system turning against Raia . . . The idea of $HeroName as Emperor-elect gains more support with each passing season, but you will have no true peace until the betrayer is uncovered, caught--and neutralized.
"Harness the mood of the empire," $HeroName counsels, "and cement your power."
"What do you mean?"
"I mean impose your will by enacting more laws."
You give a puzzled look.
$HeroName continues. "Men are strange creatures. They will rail against spoken words, but give those same words permanence in writing and they will obey to their dying breath. Never forget the power of the rule of law, Your Imperial Majesty."  
$HeroName is right. You can tighten your control of the empire by strengthening its laws.</LocalizationPair>

Your grip on the empire has never been tighter, your laws never stronger. The restless nights that plagued your last few years now seem like a bad dream. Every night you lay your head down on your imperial pillow you quickly drift into a deep sleep, waking well-rested and content. What musings thread your dreaming mind are not concerned with paranoia or rebellion or the fate of a young woman slowly growing old in the depths of the imperial prison. The question of who masterminded the rebellion all those years ago no longer vexes you like it did. You'd be lying if you said it no longer troubled you in the slightest, but like your aging body, it is something you will grow to accept. 
What occupies your thoughts more is what the historians will make of your legacy. Before you hand the reins of power over to Emperor-elect $HeroName, you must decide the fate of the empire.
Decisively.
Will you steer the empire into the hands of the Sheredyn hawks? Or will you give power to the Mezari traditionalists who exalt science? Or perhaps you believe in staying the course, seeing through the project to conquer the galaxy as the United Empire.

"Let go of the past," $HeroName says. "Your abdication ceremony is only days away."
Your abdication. Their coronation. You don't have the heart to tell them there won't be any abdication. No one can lead this new Sheredyn empire like you can. You will stay Emperor until your dying breath.

$HeroName sulks, furious, but they will come round.
You are the Emperor, after all. None disobey.
The only blemish on the whole affair comes later when you finally visit the site of the rebel shipyard.
Somebody must've got the word out that you'd discovered something; the whole place has been torched. Ash swirls, and the stench of smoke is overpowering.

Of the rebellion that troubled you so, you barely give a thought these days. You even set Julinka, the rebel outpost leader, free. After all, she was only an instrument of the true mastermind.

The transition seems to have gone down well with the rank-and-file of your population too. Strongarm diplomacy and aggressive posturing has led to an upsurge of military recruitment. More patriots than ever will lay down their lives to defend the mighty Sheredyn empire!

You know what will you do. One day $TraitorName will disappear, never to be seen again. And no one will ask any questions.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UE_Quest-Chapter4.2-UE-Description">The empire is in crisis.
 
If it is to remain united you must renew its purpose, stop the republics politicking for their own narrow self-interests. Dukes and Counts from distant worlds are becoming increasingly brazen in questioning your wisdom.
Rebellion is in the air, and this time you cannot fail to taste it.
Of the ancient rebellion that once troubled you so, you barely give a thought these days. You even set Julinka, the rebel outpost leader, free. After all, she was only an instrument of the true mastermind.
You are at peace with the past.
But the future? The future terrifies you.
Afraid, you stalk through your own empire in disguise.
Everywhere you go you hear your name sullied. In factory canteens, alleyway bars, crowded space elevators, your people spit and curse your leadership. You don't have the heart to confront them, thinking maybe they're right. Or perhaps you just lack the courage.
One night $HeroName walks with you.
"They were eager for you to become their leader."
"They were."
"More than eager," you say. "Desperate. And now they feel broken."
"They do."
"Why?"
"They are tired of breaking themselves day after day for the empire, but not partaking in the fruits of their labors. They don't mind hardship. They mind the hypocrisy."
As $HeroName says the words, you know what you must do. You must have your people--all your people--build a monument that both celebrates their achievements and brings more wealth to all. You are certain this is the answer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UE_Quest-Chapter4.2-UE-C1Description">You must renew the unity of the empire by bringing everyone together and building a living monument to your civilization's greatest strength: its industrial might.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UE_Quest-Chapter4.1-Mezari-Description">You couldn't leave it alone, could you?
With technology running more and more of the United Empire, each day you find yourself with more and more time to kill. Do you sit back, enjoy the view and marvel at where you have brought your empire? No, of course you don't. You dwell on the past. You stew in your shame and anger. Who betrayed me? Who betrayed me? It becomes a whispered litany, invading your thoughts, tormenting you.
You begin poring over the old transcripts, seeking anew clues to the identity of the betrayer . . .
Impatient for power, the Emperor-elect, $HeroName, tells you to stop wasting your days on a fruitless task.  But then? Miraculously, you find something they all overlooked--grid coordinates on a distant world. You send a lone scout, to investigate, expecting it to be nothing. But it isn't. It's a secret bunker.
"Let go of the past," $HeroName says. "Your abdication ceremony is only days away."
Your abdication. Their coronation. You don't have the heart to tell them there won't be any abdication. No one knows how to lead the United Empire as you do. You will stay Emperor until your dying breath.
The only question is do you attend the ceremony in-person and announce that you're not relinquishing your duties? Or do you miss the ceremony to pursue this lead, and let a $HeroName announce your decision?</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UE_Quest-Chapter4.1-Mezari-C1Outcome">With the rain lashing down, you arrive on a promontory close to the bunker's location. Your scout steps out of the shadows, leads you down a windswept path to the bunker entrance. You shiver, soaked through.
"Have you been inside yet?"
"No, your Imperial Majesty. As you instructed." She sends a command to her drone, and the vault door clicks open. "I did take the liberty of cracking the bunker's security protocols though."
Inside, blinking lights stutter overhead while you stalk through musty corridors. The place must've been vacated long ago, a thick sheen of dust on the floors. All the rooms are devoid of the trappings of life. From the command hub to the dorm to the living quarters, anything to help identify the people who worked in this bunker is gone. The small server farm offers hope of good intel until the drone informs you that all the drives have been magnetically erased.
As you take a quick final tour before leaving, though, you spy a tablet wedged among a bookshelf of real paper books. The drone powers it up. It's filled with cheap entertainment--pulp sci-fi, superhero comics, underground films--but one media file catches your eye. You play it.
It's video footage from this very room. The bunker's personnel are sat around, like they're waiting for something--or someone. Then a young-looking $TraitorName comes in, begins addressing the audience.
You are stunned. You feel unsteady, reach to your scout for support. All these years $TraitorName orchestrating a coup the likes of which had never been seen before. A grudge born in the last days before the empire became united . . .
You know what will you do. One day $TraitorName will disappear, never to be seen again. And no one will ask any questions.
That is the power of the Emperor. 
 
Afterwards, sat in blankets aboard your ship you watch a feed of $HeroName addressing your people. Their reaction to your continued Emperor-ship is muted. It deepens the foulness of your mood.
 
You decide that Mezari science will need to be put towards more than just inspiring discoveries . . .</LocalizationPair>

As you leave the platform, the applause is muted, and you watch some of your soldiers threatening the crowd with violence if they don't clap. Streamers fill the sky and a decorated Cruiser screams by overhead, but it can't mask the lack of enthusiasm that greets your continued leadership. You feel glum, but determined. You will show them all. You are certain you will lead your new Mezari empire to many more glories.
$HeroName sulks, furious, but they will come round.
You are the Emperor, after all. None disobey.
The only blemish on the whole affair comes later when you finally visit the secret bunker.
Somebody must've got the word out that you'd discovered something; the whole place has been torched. Ash swirls, and the stench of smoke is overpowering. You find your loyal scout's burnt body in the rubble.
It is time, you think, to finally let go of your obsession with the past. It is time to be consumed by the task of leading this Mezari empire into the future.</LocalizationPair>

Ancient rebellions may have occupied you once, but now you look ahead. What is vital is that you wield the great instrument of Mezari science to ensure no others ever rise up against you again.
What stings most is your people's reaction to your announcement that you were not stepping aside. You will charge your finest scientists with the task of discovering the secrets of closed minds. You will found a great institute. No expense will be spared. No research will be prohibited.

Best of all, $HeroName no longer smarts from no longer being named Emperor-elect, and has devoted themselves fully to the work of the empire. Perhaps the sudden disappearance of $TraitorName helped sway their mind.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HoratioQuest-Chapter1-Part1-IntroDescription">The three of us stood around that table, a spectacle for all Horatio to consume. Gorgeous, brilliant, and indistinguishable. The guards and attendants had one question only: Who was the original?
 
I claimed to be, of course; every bit as beautiful and as smart as either of the other two. That had to be the case, for we were the most perfect copies--biological, psychological, developmental--that the most advanced cloning science of the galaxy could make. No scientific test existed that could tell us apart; each one of the three of us a microcosm of Horatio perfection. Yet only one was the real Horatio, Horatio Prime.
 
I wondered what parents had brought that Horatio up, had developed that magnificent brain into what it was. And I wondered how Horatio managed to imprint that upbringing as if it was a technical issue, like replicating DNA. Can a thing from a test tube have daddy issues?
 
We aligned ourselves with each other, Five and I, determined to avoid the fate of One, Two, and Three.. They had died in the lab, once Horatio Prime realized what we were thinking. Subtly we knew who was who, and he gave me his support when I claimed to be Horatio, the Original, Horatio Prime, the Light. And so I was crowned emperor, the gorgeous leader of a gorgeous empire. And Prime was put in chains.
 
But I know Five as well as he knows me--or Horatio himself. The minute he is out of my sight, he will scheme against me.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%TimeLordsQuest-Chapter1-Part1-IntroDescription">The universe is utterly unlike our own. Burning orbs of fire, scarred balls of rock hanging in the void, vast realms of nothingness.
Empty, pitiless, terrifying.
Some of the worlds are more than barren, airless rocks. Cloaked in dirt that seems fertile ground for tenacious, foliaged forms, they choke the surface and deny the light. Strange things stalk and shuffle and slither through the undergrowth.
We were fortunate to avoid settling on such a world. Our world, the world we named Vanguard on account of us being the spearhead, is a white wilderness broken only by still and silent forests, icy brooks, and perpetual grey skies. In its near-ceaseless white embrace, where the sky can sometimes be mistaken for the land, it is reminiscent of the homeland but if you look closer it cannot hide its grotesqueness. Things scurry under the snow, others open dark wings among the shadows; chilly waters crash and shriek against rocks; worst of all bursts of color sometimes burst forth unexpectedly--sunlight on fish scales, winter meadows blooming with flowers, sweeping curtains of green and purple light in the starry night.
No words can do the horror justice.
My forces suffer, but they are resolute. Their suffering is nothing as next to the plague that spreads through the homeland, Coroz. Every message from the Communion speaks of the blight growing, more and more of the world becoming dead and blackened.
There are many paths we might follow to end this nightmare. Even in the little time I have spent in this world, I have begun to form my own ideas for what is best. But I am merely an instrument of the Communion, faithfully relaying the situation here to the best of my ability. They decide.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%TimeLordsQuest-Chapter1.Part2-IntroDescription">Today, one of my patrols made a startling discovery.
A curious, pitiful creature was found living in a windswept hovel on the edge of a great frozen lake far to the north. This universe, with its ugly forms, its soul-shuddering sounds, its perpetual downwards grasping, is difficult enough to understand at the best of times, but this creature was another level of enigma. With rags for garments, garbled speech, and erratic movements of its slender, serrated limbs, I wondered what possible worth this thing could possess? Over long, painful days, though, I came to appreciate that this creature, Anax-Jink, could be very valuable to us.
Although Anax-Jink is a damaged soul, half-mad, half-delusional, its mind driven down dark, rarely traveled paths in its prolonged isolation, I found islands of clarity, even brilliance. Slowly, I learnt its story.
It is a member of a race called the Virus. Well, maybe "race" is too generous a word for the smattering of creatures scattered across the galaxy who loosely share Anax-Jink's biology. The Virus, you see, are escaped viral lab experiments, hyper-evolved by a mysterious substance called Dust. Anax-Jink once lived with others, a commune of Eyder on an abandoned moon, but after it stole a great haul of Dust for research they fell out and Anax-Jink was banished.
The Virus tells me the end-times are coming. I struggle to fathom whether its reasoning is genius or deranged, but knowing what I know of the blight destroying Coroz I cannot help but think its words are prophetic. It has the capacity for greatness, I believe.
I have forbidden anybody mention Anax-Jink's existence to the Communion back on Coroz. To begin with that was because I needed to know more before I reported back, but too much time has passed for that to be true any longer, and now I must confront the truth. The truth is that the Communion are ill-equipped to lead in this universe. They are remote and out of touch, insulated from the seeping horror of this place. How can they make the right choices when they have no experience of here? They can't.
So I, the Grand Viceroy of New Coroz, will decide the fate of Anax-Jink.
One day, the Communion will thank me for it.</LocalizationPair>

Given the choice again, I would make the same decision. Besides, we learnt much of its biochemistry, its cellular structure by slicing up its brain. This may be priceless knowledge in our fight for survival.
Life in this world still disgusts me, but I am the Grand Viceroy and I have my duty.

Witnessing the carnage, something broke in Anax-Jink. It lashed out at two of my personal guard, then scuttled deep into the shadows. We searched for it for the rest of the day, but found no trace of the Virus. Perhaps it is better this way.
This world grows more terrible by the day. I have my duty, but I don't know how much more horror I can endure.</LocalizationPair>

Every day I receive reports of new areas of our world becoming diseased, new casualties succumbing to stasis. I picture black, serpentine tendrils choking everything I once cherished. Even in this place, with my capacity to crush and stretch time like it is nothing more than a spring, I cannot escape the brutal, heavy truth of our plight.
The Communion press for a full evacuation into this world. They imagine it a safe haven, where they might find refuge. They are mistaken. This universe is far from a sanctuary for us. It is a dirty, fetid place, awash with violence. The only thing they will find here is distress, and eventually death. Despite their suffering, we are just not ready for them. They should stay. Fight to the end to save Coroz.
But they will not.
I beg. No matter how hard I persuade them not to venture into this universe, my pleas fall on indifferent minds. All the horrors that I communicate--the blinding light, the fierce cold, the vast abysses--are merely meaningless words to them. They have no conception of this place. And as I am only the Grand Viceroy of New Coroz, as my authority stops where this universe ends, I cannot forbid them from coming.
Eventually, though, I manage a minor victory of sorts. I convince them to delay the evacuation, give my forces enough time to prepare for their arrival.
What can I do though? I might as well be seeking the end of the primes. Staring up at the starry night, I feel the weight of the universe crushing me, suffocating.

I wonder . . . should Coroz ever be cleansed of the blight would I be able to return? Or am I forever changed? Am I destined to live out my years here in this universe?
A moot question, perhaps. News from Coroz suggests no breakthrough in slowing, or even understanding, the blight. Perhaps if the Communion invested more of their energies on investigating the rift and less on spying on me, they might've made more progress. Yes, they learnt of the existence of the Virus, Anax-Jink, and their reprimand was severe. Keep anything else from us, they said, and you will be stripped of the title of Grand Viceroy and ordered to return to Coroz immediately. They didn't need to say what fate would await me there.
I will not be so careless in the future.
The Communion wish our efforts to be focused on the rift. The presence of the Virus affords us an opportunity to study it in detail, so that is certainly possible. We already know that some type of rupture in this universe precipitated the emergence of the rift, but we don't know the details. Anax-Jink will help rectify that.
Or, I can focus my efforts on cementing my own authority, being ready for unforeseen events . . . the construction of a supremely powerful vessel would be a rational choice to fight off our enemies--without or within.

There was a vessel.
The Grey Owl.
Aboard it carried a Dust artifact of enormous power. Somehow it became unstable, exploded.
The rest was inevitable.
Worse, Anax-Jink tells me there is no hope of arresting the blight; the plague is a manifestation of the physics of one universe strangling the physics of another. Soon, inevitably, Coroz will be an endless blackened wasteland, devoid of life.

The Communion have given the order for a full evacuation of Coroz.
I haven't witnessed it firsthand, but the reports show our once beautiful home rendered into a corrupt wasteland, the population corralled into smaller and smaller zones of safety.
Those that venture into the blight, I am told, never return.
I feel their plight, I truly do, but I am torn.
This universe is no sanctuary.
It is a hellish realm of vast voids and burning suns, settled by strange creatures each striving to be the dominant species. To survive any Riftborn must cast off their old ideas, harden themselves, be ready for suffering.
I fear most will not survive here.
Worse, I fear that their presence might doom us all.
The arrival of the Communion is another matter. Are they worldly enough for this universe? Or will they lead us into oblivion?
During a battle in some far-flung system whose name escapes me, I once saw a Craver get pinned by a falling comms tower. Its arm must've been crushed, useless. Unable to move, it would've shortly been executed by our approaching forces.

It severed its own arm and kept fighting.

Rumors spread that I left them in Coroz, or eliminated them during their transit to this universe. The rumors are useful tools for control, and I do little to dispel them.
Sometimes I wonder if this universe has changed me too much. Sometimes I wonder if this place of constant conflict and bargaining and deceit has altered the very character of the Riftborn.
I often wonder if survival is enough.
The Communion might be hidden from sight, gone in the minds of my people, but that doesn't mean they don't exert their influence. Every day I grant them an audience, and we enjoy lively discussions about the future. With little to do in their gilded cage except absorb news from across the galaxy, they make a circle of most insightful advisors. With Coroz gone, dead and blackened, they have convinced me that we must begin to take steps to resurrect our cosmos in this universe.
Only then will we truly remember who we are.
The Communion might be dead to all, but that doesn't mean they won't have a legacy.
None will know this, of course.
None, except me.</LocalizationPair>

Riftborn researchers make great strides understanding the fundamental nature of matter in the universe, but still struggle to render Corozian artifacts here. One day it will happen though.
One day it has to happen.
The Communion, forever locked in their impregnable fortress, have come to accept their station. They are the ones I am closest to, the only ones I can speak entirely freely with. Through their collective wisdom, my influence over my citizens has never been greater.
Despite the seasons that have passed, I still find this universe an infernal wasteland.

Some have seen my actions as genocide, when the truth is they are a mercy. A vocal but powerful minority stoke the feelings of the masses, encouraging them to move to a full-blown rebellion. They want passage from Coroz re-opened, even if it might cost us everything.
These protests are not the Riftborn way.
They are another sign that we are losing our identity to this universe. Perhaps that is the only way we will survive though. By forgetting who we were, and embracing this place of chaos and conflict.
I don't know.
The free exchange of ideas has always been a cornerstone of our way of life, but if I permit these dissenting voices to carry on challenging my authority I fear all might be lost. Compelling evidence has come my way that the ringleaders of this incipient mutiny are meeting for critical talks aboard a secret fleet at the borders of Riftborn space.

The Communion remain happy to let me lead. I think they are all still shell-shocked by the reality of this universe. They don't want the responsibility of command, and I cannot blame them for that. What they knew--what we all knew--in Coroz is gone. Tranquility, beauty, truth . . . all lost to a cosmos that values conflict above all.
Perhaps they let me lead because they see that I have changed. I--among all of us that have called this universe home--understand best what we must do to survive.
We must strive. We must fight. We must kill.
Every day. Every hour. Every second.
We have mastered time, and we will use that strength to master the galaxy.
Nothing living has emerged from Coroz for days, but that doesn't stop many calling for us to return. I have cautioned against raising hopes that we might return, but the Communion instruct me to organize an exploratory party.
I am sure they will only find blackened ruin--that is, if they return to tell the tale--but perhaps that will be the spur that will harden us, inure us to this harsh cosmos.

Yesterday three returned.
One was mind-dead, the second was delirious, and the third, while coherent, was infected by a virulent strain of the blight.
All were kept in separate isolation facilities. The first shows no signs of recovery and will likely be deactivated soon. The second killed itself, executing a proliferation script in its core which we were unable to counteract in time. The prognosis for the third looked bleak, but somehow it survived the night.
Still focused on its mission, it ignored its own suffering and damage, and relayed to us as much as it could about the party's expedition and the state of Coroz. The short version is that not only is our old home uninhabitable, it is also evolving in dangerous and unpredictable ways. Alive some might say.
Return is impossible.
We are stranded in this universe. Not without hope though. Not only did the sole survivor bring back much valuable analysis. In its infected state it also brought back secrets of Dust.

My inner circle fear me, and they transmit this feeling onto their own subordinates. We are a colder race now, but we are also stronger for it. Our survival in this universe depends on it.
The ringleaders of the rebellion remain in an incarceration singularity, their physical forms held aloft in stasis for all to see like flies trapped in amber, while their minds roam time and space.
Their example helps keep my grip iron.
A strange thing happened with one of the prisoners. Seventeen day-night cycles ago, 534628634's vital parameters spiked. The Custodians brought it out of the singularity, and quickly sent word that I must come.
Once stabilized, 534628634 claimed to have a detailed vision of the future. That two cycles hence, a phalanx of Riftborn from Coroz would try to breach the rift, escape into the Endless galaxy. Intense hallucinations are not uncommon when under a singularity, but the visions are always mangled fragments of imagination and reality, giving more insight into the dreamer's mind than any objective reality.
Everything 534628634 described came to pass.
And thanks to its words we were ready.
Since then every one of its premonitions has come true. For its candor, I give it certain comforts the other prisoners are denied. We have an understanding. How long it can endure though, before descending into madness I do not know, but until then I will heed its words.
Now it tells me the Riftborn must spread among the stars to stave off calamity. And so that's what I will do.</LocalizationPair>

It is a loss, but 534628634's sacrifice taught me something important.
Every Riftborn can give more.
Of course, finding another oracle of 534628634's caliber will be difficult, perhaps impossible, but that doesn't mean more cannot be extracted out of every Riftborn who sheaths themselves in a robotic shell.
I will work them harder.
And they will not complain because they will understand they are securing their race's survival. No cost is too great for that aim.
I will make sure they understand that.
And if any forget that lesson I will bring them to the singularity where the other flies are still trapped in the amber, and offer them the chance of becoming my new oracle.</LocalizationPair>

In the meantime, I will continue making all operational decisions from the austere comfort of the Breach Provisional Authority's main base, upon condition I am not to leave the structure.
I am under guard at all times.
For the sake of our race's survival I will obey.
The Communion have given me the strategic aim of promoting a doctrine of peace. They are new to this universe and haven't yet developed the passion for violence that seems to be endemic to survival here. Perhaps it gives us a chance to start again.
Or perhaps it heralds our demise.
In any case, I will respect their wishes--at least outwardly. To this end, I will concentrate Riftborn exploitation ventures on securing the strategic resources necessary to defend ourselves. Singularities will help us to arrange the pieces of the galaxy as we see fit, while stronger fleets will allow us to patrol safely. Specialists will be sent to the strategic mining sites tasked with one objective: maximizing yields.
I don't know what the Communion's judgment will be. I don't know what fate awaits me.

Even more than I led my Communion judges to believe, in fact.
Despite my careful stewardship though, the Communion, in their infinite wisdom, have decided to tarnish me with the title of Outsider for my previous sins. If we were in Coroz I would be banished to travel the Nothing, the great expanse devoid of all meaning, but here I wear the name of Outsider like a badge of honor.
Here, I became something other than Riftborn, and by doing so I gave my race a chance of survival. The Communion understand this fact, and in recognition they have given me their consent to remain as leader.
They give me the name Outsider, so that none forget.
They are wise, but I will never let myself be at the mercy of their judgment again.
The extra riches I squirrel away every cycle will see to that.
Soon I won't need their consent.
Soon I will be in complete command.

The first of us came to life fully conscious, as if from one day to the next the dawn changed us.
We did not worry ourselves with this, however; for ages, we simply grew and thought, listening to the Heart and learning about our world, Koyasil. We sunk our roots deep into the soil to see what lay beneath, we gazed at the stars and tracked their passage across the sky.
Why seek anything else? What more is required of life?
Then these Others came, bringing their conflicts and their violence, driving us into self-doubt and confusion. To ask, "Where did they come from?", is a brief step away from asking, "And where did we come from?" We hear the murmurs of the Heart, and it soothes us. It speaks to us of serenity and strength. But the old reassurances are no longer enough; they fade with the old vision of the universe. It seems we are one small clod of dirt in an unthinkably vast galaxy, and now we must raise up our limbs, shake out our roots, and look beyond Koyasil.
Some say we do not need to look outward; we have Koyasil and the Heart, and they will protect and guide us.

As our wisdom grew we saw that it was merely excited electrons and some now belittle Fire, calling it a tool that we should exploit. They say that Fire and its descendants--fossil fuels, fission, fusion--are, like Fire, dangerous but useful.
But some look to the sun and the wind for power, seeking to use natural forms of energy rather than those that rely upon destruction.
This is an old debate, and one that will not finish in my lifetime. But the basic philosophies of the Unfallen are simple: Everything begins, and ends, with Fire.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnfallenQuest-Chapter2-Part1-IntroDescription">Mafaza, an aging Second who would doubtless be dormant by now had the others not arrived, has come forward as the champion of tradition. Once a Firekeeper, she is now a steady voice for calm and introspection. Her greatest foil is Atelata, who has raised his limbs under distant suns and met many other peoples. One argues for continuity and the other for adaptation; one preaches adhering to custom and the other insists on radical evolution of government and society.
The Heart speaks to us, as she always has. Our conscience and our guide, she is a voice within all Unfallen that is both god and counselor. As we share what we have learned of our cosmos the words of the Heart are clear: Our role is to understand the Other and speak with the Other. The passion of the Heart is clear in this, for we have felt tremors in her that have never before been sensed--even in the memories of the oldest of the Thirds.
We must study other species as we have studied ourselves, for the Heart will not accept anger and conflict when dialogue and harmony are possible. The Heart accepts the need for Fire, but only for the Fire that renews. The Fire that destroys has no place among the Unfallen.
Yet some speak of our new knowledge as something like the Fire that destroys, for if we must adapt and grow and change, the oldest among us will be lost and left behind. What is the value of a Third, who has lived centuries in an unchanging world, and whose store of life wisdom becomes less and less valuable? These questions drive to the foundations of our civilization, and even the reassuring pulse of the Heart does not soothe us.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnfallenQuest-Chapter3-Part1-IntroDescription">Technology, civilizations, history... 
We are unused to seeing and learning so much, to absorbing this quantity of information. Or "data", as some now call it. Events, discoveries, and artifacts fall upon us like torrential rain; it is all we can do to not be swept away. The Heart beats more strongly now, as though driven by our concern. 
New knowledge is absorbed as quickly as it can be, and when it is too great or too complex it drains like water into our subconscious and is captured there by the Heart, biding its time to resurface and be integrated and understood at a pace more natural to the rhythms of the Unfallen.
Maintaining our reason and equilibrium becomes more and more difficult, but the Unfallen are nothing if not hardy and resolute. Still, the new knowledge brings a challenge we had not considered, one that digs at the corners of our society. Do we grow, change, and evolve, or do we fall back upon the ways we know and ride out the turmoil? Is the chaos of the galaxy simply a new analogy for Fire, and if so, is it the Fire that renews, or the Fire that destroys? It would be good if we could discover these answers before this Fire becomes too powerful for our control.

Mafaza claims that the Heart is a living spirit, older than the Endless, that has watched over the Unfallen since the birth of our world.  
Atelata, on the other hand, refers to the Heart as an artificial proto-consciousness trapped within the mechanical interior of the planet – an interior whose existence has only recently been affirmed by Sophon scientists.
And I? I would that the Heart were a repository of knowledge, a god, and a reliable ally in troubling times. But the crutch of religion has been removed from me, and I now believe that the Heart is anything but mystical. Still it is also not imaginary. It is there, it throbs, it whispers. But we do not know if it is an aspect of the collective consciousness of the Unfallen, or an some entity external to our people.
But we are all agreed; until we have this answer, we cannot know who we are, and what our destiny is. Is the Heart spirit or technology? Are we Light, or are we Fire?</LocalizationPair>

We see now, however, that we are both ancient and young, born of both nature and technology. We do not choose between Fire and Light. We are the Unfallen. We are both.</LocalizationPair>

Criminal elements can be kept busy, hidden taxes can be skimmed, and interesting contraband can be smuggled into the nation for the leadership's pleasure.
However, black markets for illegal firearms is another matter. Especially when it enables enemy civilizations to get their hands, tentacles, or other appendages, on some of the empire's most effective weaponry. The unfortunate truth is that some of your undercover security forces have unearthed compelling evidence that a gun smuggling ring is operating out of three of your systems.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest13-IntroTitle">Riftborn Blues - Part 1</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest13-IntroDescription">The Endless universe is taking its toll on the valiant Riftborn who have travelled through the rift and embodied their spiritual essences in strange robotic shells. They thirst for a taste of Coroz, and long for a reprieve from the organic horrors of this universe. Their minds desire the ordered lines and perfect symmetry of the home dimension.
Sadly, the blight still spreads through Coroz. Any return, no matter how short is too risky and not an option. The Communion have forbidden it, ordering that all those who have crossed must stay in this galaxy and give everything to their race's survival.
But there is an answer--or at least, a partial one.
You may not be able to return to Coroz, but that doesn't mean you can't bring Coroz to here. First you need to find a suitable system where the Riftborn can begin to relax . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest13-Description">Only a system harboring the most barren and meager planets will suffice as a place of rest for the Riftborn. You don't want to stumble across any loathsome organic matter, after all.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest14-IntroDescription">Well, it was never going to be paradise, but $MyColonizedStarSystemLocalizationName is still not even adequate for Riftborn recuperation. Sunrises and sunsets, algae and microbes, wind and rain--even in the most barren places of this universe the Riftborn can't get away from its tortures.
For $MyColonizedStarSystemLocalizationName to become a true sanctuary for this galaxy's most far reaching visitors, much more work needs to be done. The environment needs to be completely transformed into a real echo of their home dimension, Coroz. Only then might they gain respite.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest14-Description">The secret ingredients for $MyColonizedStarSystemLocalizationName's transformation are Luxuries. The substance is critical for numbing the senses and tricking the mind.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest01-Title">Dust To Dust - Part 1</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest01-Description">In the midst of a small asteroid belt, your scouts have discovered a unique crystalline building, a fractal-like lattice whose sheer intricacy boggles the mind. As your probe stops to gather a tiny sample, a massive chunk crumbles off, rotating slowly in place.
The sample has some very strange properties. It appears to have some sort of weak directional resonance, like a needle in an undetectable magnetic field. Your scientists have never seen anything like it.
Your fleet has its orders, of course. But you wonder if diverting your mission to seek out the source of this strange crystal-affecting field could prove profitable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest01-Description01">With your scientist baffled, this is too good a chance to learn something potentially revolutionary. Even if it's out of the way, orbiting the asteroid field is the smart choice. </LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest01-Failed">This Quest has failed</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest01-Outcome">Using your crystal sample as a guide, you've led your fleet to a large, barren planet, apparently rich in minerals. But your scanners pick up no signs of life. Your team sets up a temporary camp on the surface, taking the opportunity to gather some potentially useful resources while a smaller group makes an exploratory sweep.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest02-Title">Dust To Dust - Part 2</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest02-Description">After performing a brief survey, one of your geologists has come to you with astonishing news. This planet is littered with thousands of small pockets of Dust--not Dust in its natural form, but Dust scattered in clumps and jagged patterns in the crystalline bedrock: almost as if the planet had once been violently struck by thousands of Dust-bonded meteorites. A simple piezoelectric test confirms your geologist's suspicions. She advises that it will take months of further study before the Dust can be extracted in any usable form.
You do not mention it to her, but the planet gives you a strange feeling--you feel as if you are treading over a long-forgotten graveyard. 
But a spare cache of Dust could be useful . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest02-Description01"> The dead are dead, and even if this might be a somewhat disrespectful act, your empire needs the Dust.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest03-Outcome">The dust settles and your ships limp, smoking, out of the atmosphere. During the battle, you caught a glimpse of one of the attacking ships: a ship made of bright blue crystal, hidden beneath a layer of rock. Your thoughts flit to the first thing that comes to mind: an ancient race called the Harmony, who were supposedly wiped out centuries ago by a plague created by the Endless. But your historical knowledge is lacking. You make a mental note to read up more when you have the time.
On your ship's bridge, your geologist and you share a look of relief. The majority of your crew has survived the day -- perhaps, for the moment, that is the most important thing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest05-IntroTitle">The Good Life</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest05-IntroDescription">While exploring this planet, you come across a small, harmless community of Horatio. Apparently the survivors of a crash-landed spacecraft, these people have lived on the planet for over a decade, enjoying the tropical climate and adorning their habitations with rocks, shells, and other useless objects.
They seem quite surprised when you tell them their little conclave is just one or two years away from being wiped out by a natural cataclysm. 
Help them find a new place to live, won't you?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest05-Description">Given the imminent cataclysm, the need to relocate the Horatio enclave is clear. Fortunately, the "beautiful" ones should bring some useful benefits too.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest06-Description">A group of archaeologists from your exploration party has come to you with a bizarre report: they claim to have seen a ghostly airship, made of balloons and solar panels, silently traversing the planet's skies. You are initially skeptical, but one of your historians insists that the airship matches the mythical description of Hoce, an ancient Endless who watched from the skies as her home planet, Kyros, was converted to a gray goo by a nanoplague.
Hoce is long dead with the rest of the Endless, and this planet could not possibly be Kyros. But the story seems to have captured the imaginations of your crew, who are now speaking of founding a colony here.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest06-Objective01">Create an Outpost on the planet $PlanetName or colonize its System.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest06-Outcome">New Hoce, they call it, though none of the new colony's inhabitants have ever reported another sighting of the ghostly ship.
It is said that Hoce perished aboard her lost airship, mourning the death of her mate and waiting for the gods to come and transform Kyros back into the paradise it once was. Perhaps, so many years after Hoce and the fall of the Endless, the gods have finally come.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%AcademyQuest01-Coop-Intro-Title">Rumor of an Academy</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%AcademyQuest01-Coop-Intro-Description">There are heroes, and there are Heroes. Legends of prowess, familiar to all yet witnessed by none--the heroes of these tall tales are a dime a dozen.
But in the leaders you have met and in the murmurs of your crews and colleagues, there are stories of other heroes. Living Heroes, whose actions and efforts have changed the course of battles and bureaucracies, whose actions and decisions have been pivotal in the rise and fall of empires.
And when one speaks of these Heroes, masters of Dust and its vast powers, one also speaks of the place where they studied, where they learned these feats of strength and genius.
It is simply referred to as "The Academy". Some seem to present it as a center of higher learning, while others mention it in tones more suitable to worship and epiphany.
It would be good to know the truth of all this; it would be good if your ships were the first to make formal contact with it and meet its leader, shrouded in mystery.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%AcademyQuest01-Coop-Description">They are as few in number as they are great in power, the Heroes of the galaxy. They learned their skills at a place simply referred to as "The Academy". 
Be the first to find this place, and some of its secrets will certainly be yours.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%AcademyQuest01-Coop-Outcome1">Cross-referencing signal information and known Hero movement indicates the Academy is likely in one of three systems. It is time to find out exactly where it is, and meet the puissant being who founded it ages ago.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%AcademyQuest01-Coop-Outcome2">Another empire has discovered the location of the Academy. This quest is no longer relevant.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%AcademyQuest01-Coop-Failed">The Academy has been discovered. Where your efforts failed, another was successful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%AcademyQuest02-Compet-Intro-Title">Find The Academy</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%AcademyQuest02-Compet-Intro-Description">No one is even sure of the origin of the being that founded the Academy--whether they are human, Endless, alien, or some unknown form. All stories agree, however, that any being touched by Dust who finds that secretive place and survives its rigors emerges deeply changed--and greatly enhanced.
A visit, a word with the leader, an understanding of why the Academy exists and what purpose it serves . . . There are many mysteries surrounding the Academy, and claiming it is either a place of research into Dust or a profitable services business seems somehow a bit glib.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%AcademyQuest02-Compet-Description">The Academy appears to be located in one of three systems. Visit them with a fleet and you may be the first to discover it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%AcademyQuest02-Compet-Objective">Explore the three indicated Systems with a fleet in order to find the Academy and visit its leader.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%AcademyQuest02-Compet-Outcome">The location of the Academy has been revealed! There appears to be a bonus for the faction that first made contact. And now, it is time to both take advantage of its services and discover its mysteries. The first mystery solved is the name of its leader. He is a Vodyani, named Isyander St Shaiad, who founded it centuries ago.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%AcademyQuest02-Compet-Failed">The Academy has been discovered. Where your efforts failed, another was successful. Through diplomatic channels you learn that its founder and leader is a Vodyani.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%AcademyQuest03-A-Coop-Intro-Description">The Academy and the Heroes who refine their skills there can turn the tides of battles and vastly enrich systems. It is not surprising, therefore, that all civilizations in this galaxy secretly desire insight into and control over that powerful establishment.
There are also, however, some peoples for whom the Academy is an insult and an abomination. Chief among these are the hardline conservatives of the Vodyani, for it is said that the leader of the Academy has an ancient religious dispute with them.
These rumors appear to be true, as splinter fleets of Vodyani extremists are appearing around the galaxy to come together and attack the Academy. If they succeed, the place and its founder are likely to be destroyed, and its secrets lost.</LocalizationPair>

It is not surprising, therefore, that all civilizations in this galaxy secretly desire insight and control of that powerful establishment.
Word has come out from the establishment, however, that they seek additional growth and recruitment from the lesser civilizations of the galaxy. Apparently the secretive leader of the Academy feels that these less powerful communities of sentients are underrepresented and underserved on the stage of galactic diplomacy.
His request seems a bit odd, but there is advantage to be gained and knowledge to be gleaned.</LocalizationPair>

But as you hear the stories that circulate about the Academy, ancient gods, and upcoming cataclysms, it occurs to you that you might want to boost your approval and your empire's productivity.

But there is one sure way to get all the attention you desire from the Academy: Dust. As the old saying goes, "Dust talks". If you can control both starlanes and Dust with a powerful Trading Company, you will certainly merit an audience with Isyander.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MetaplotQuest-TeamPlay-Chapter1-Intro-Description">You are cursed to live in interesting times.
The leader of the Academy, and those who follow or trust him, have decided to put their endgame plan into motion. The “what” or “why” of it is no longer debatable; it is happening. Some will side with them in their crusade to bring back the Lost, a race of beings harvested and eliminated by the Endless. Others will oppose them, for it is rumored that the Lost, when congregated in large numbers, had the power of gods.
Which are you? The time has come to choose, for Isyander’s words have been heard by all civilizations in the galaxy.
”The time of penance has come. Wrongs must be righted, the innocent restored, and evil purged. None of us were actors in the original crime, but all of us bear the curse of knowledge and responsibility. Those of us who would see justice done will act. Are you with us, or against us? Will you see the Lost restored, or tacitly condone the act of genocide?”

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MetaplotQuest-TeamPlay-Chapter2-Intro-Description">The challenge has been made and the opponents, like mystical astrological planets, align themselves. The Rejuvenators seek to control the Lodestones, and at those three sites execute the Dust ritual that would instill life back into the spirit of a Lost. Their goal is justice and retribution on a cosmic scale; wiping the slate clean and starting over with a less corrupt galaxy.
The Defenders refuse this usurpation of their own destinies; whether the Lost are benevolent, malevolent, or indifferent they will not summon other beings who are capable of meddling in their future.
The first phase has passed, for the Lodestones have been discovered and occupied. The places are set, the cards laid out, the opponents identified.
The end begins.</LocalizationPair>

"We are a proud race. Our culture forbids us from bowing down to those whose strength is inadequate."
You begin to describe your empire's power--its vast industrial bases, shining fleets, disciplined armies--but the $MinorFactionName interrupts--
"Those things are only reflections of an empire's true strength--its people." The $MinorFactionName looks dismissively at your surrounding retinue. "Grow your numbers and we might begin to consider you a worthy master."</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest01-Choice01Description">That the $MinorFactionName equate strength with raw population numbers feels primitive in many ways, but it is an easy enough challenge to handle.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest02-IntroDescription">"I'm sorry, master, but the $MinorFactionName were most insistent you hear this message personally."

You nod. Go ahead.

A grainy holographic begins playing. Interference periodically interrupts the $MinorFactionName representative and his words are rushed, but you understand the gist. A prominent $MinorFactionName has been abducted, and they want you to help.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest02-Choice01Description">With your sophisticated forensics, analysis of the circumstances of the kidnap enables the kidnapper's vessel to be identified and tracked. Now it just needs to be caught!</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest02-Choice01Outcome">A curious story emerges once your soldiers have the kidnapper in laser shackles. The $MinorFactionName believes that the representative he kidnapped was in secret talks with a shady organization named "The Academy". You say nothing. All you really care right now is the addition of the $MinorFactionName to you growing empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest03-IntroTitle">A Prophecy of Doom</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest03-IntroDescription">It might seem quaint or even childish to you, but the $MinorFactionName hold a deep belief that a great catastrophe is soon to wreak havoc on their homeworld. The nature of this coming catastrophe is unclear, and they refuse to enter into any dialogue as to its origin.
What they ask from you is to give them adequate engineering expertise so they might survive the catastrophe in the vast subterranean halls that they want to build.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest03-Choice01Description">It seems doubtful there is any impending catastrophe, no sign of asteroid collision, environmental collapse, or any other extinction-level event.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest04-IntroTitle">A Cry For Help</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest04-IntroDescription">"We picked up the signal three days ago," says the $MinorFactionName representative, looking apprehensive. "May I?"
You wave a hand. Yes.
The audio is distorted, and an unholy wailing din can be heard in the background, but the speaker's whispered words are clear.
"S-s-something escaped from the labs. And none of the others have come back." Their words suddenly become louder. "Somebody has to help us! For all our sakes!"
The audio stops.
"How old is the signal?" you ask.
"We have no idea," the $MinorFactionName says.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest04-Choice01Description">The signal is of $MinorFactionName origin, but where it hails from is uncertain. Whatever escaped from the labs should be no match for your experienced explorers, though. You just need to locate it.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest04-Choice01ObjectiveTooltip">Send an Explorer vessel to Systems containing Curiosities and then use the Start Expedition action.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest04-Choice01Outcome">Entering the lab complex, your expedition leader reports some grisly findings. Fluid trails, desiccated bodies, wholesale slaughter. The advanced state of decomposition of the victims suggests this happened long ago, only the sealed environment preventing complete deterioration. Whatever--or whoever--did this is long gone. You instruct your team to recover the dead to return to the $MinorFactionName.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest05-IntroTitle">Benedictions In The Church Of Dust</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest05-IntroDescription">Truth be told, the Dust-obsessed religious fanatics of the $MinorFactionName splinter group are an unnerving crowd.
Unnerving but powerful.
The opinions of this small group can easily tilt the balance in the decision to join your empire. So when the leader looms close, eyes intense, and asks, "Will you help us?", you don't really have much choice.
They worship Dust and they want you to send a Hero to cement their political influence among the population. It could be a good move for making the $MinorFactionName more accommodating . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest05-Choice01Description">Dust, the most powerful substance in the universe. No wonder they worship it. Sending a Hero on the splinter group's behalf would certainly make a powerful statement. Why not?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest05-Choice01Objective">Assign a Hero to a Fleet, then send the Fleet to the $MinorFactionHomeSystemName System and orbit for $AmountName [turn].</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest05-Choice01Outcome">Parading your hero through the streets of the $MinorFactionName capital made a considerable impression on the population.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest06-IntroTitle">All Those Yesterdays</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest06-IntroDescription">"Please help me."
The $MinorFactionName slumps in the sand, sobbing. Waves break on the shore, the wash racing up the beach, soaking his lower half. You stare out at the endless ocean, thinking on his incredible story over and over again. He told you that on this very same beach, twenty of his years ago, a strange being in a strange craft landed here, took away his son. He was powerless to stop it, but he remembers one word the being said: Iskvola. He carried the word for years, never giving up hope of one day being reunited with his son. And then he heard it uttered by another visitor--a being who called himself a member of the Vodyani.
Iskvola was the name of an ancient ruin somewhere among the stars.
He wants you to find it-- and learn what you can about his son.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest06-Choice01Description">The $MinorFactionName has risen to become a powerful player in his society. Helping him might give you leverage--as well as giving him a chance of peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest06-Choice01Objective">Explore Ruin-type Curiosities until you discover Iskvola.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest06-Choice01ObjectiveTooltip">Send an Explorer vessel to Systems containing Ruin-type Curiosities and then use the Start Expedition action.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest06-Choice01Outcome">By a miracle of miracles, your expedition team do indeed find an ancient site known as Iskvola. But in the decrepit, sand-blasted ruins they make a grim discovery--the dead husk of young $MinorFactionName, drained of Essence. You return the dead child to his father, who only gives the slightest pause before embracing his lifeless son.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest07-IntroTitle">Predators of the Kazinka Cleft</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest07-IntroDescription">For years isolated settlements of the $MinorFactionName have suffered at the hands of a predatory band operating out of the Kazinka Cleft.
They are not without a sense of humor, though. Despite pillaging hardware, fuel, foodstuffs, and domesticated animals, the pirates often grace their captive victims with a theatrical show before making off with their stolen goods. Plays, musicals, even slapstick comedies have been known to be performed, and they have a reputation as excellent players.
Now, however, their luck has ran out as they happened to rob kin of one of the $MinorFactionName leadership.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest07-Choice01Description">It is somewhat of a shame to help shutdown this merry band of thieves, but their actions are creating hardships for many on the fringes of $MinorFactionName society. Plus, of course, your interest is not entirely motivated by concern for others . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest07-Choice01ObjectiveTooltip">Send a military fleet to the mercenary fleet system to engage</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest07-Choice01Objective">Destroy the mercenary fleet somewhere in a nearby system.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest07-Choice01Outcome">The thieves won't be troubling the $MinorFactionName fringe dwellers again, their ships obliterated, their leaders imprisoned. Perhaps one day they can be fully rehabilitated and become theater directors.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest08-IntroTitle">The Hidden Cabal</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest08-IntroDescription">The $MinorFactionName leadership are adamant. A shadowy group are plotting to overthrow their government.
Pressed on the identity of these revolutionaries, all the leadership will say is that they think their society has been infiltrated by a collective of alien races who have posted a number of operatives on the world. They believe that these operatives meet periodically in deserted locations, and soon plan to assassinate the leaders and take power for themselves.
To protect themselves, the $MinorFactionName would be happy to come under you wing--provided one condition is satisfied: you prove that you are a race that abides by the rule of law.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest08-Choice01Description">The $MinorFactionName would be very useful for helping you achieve your goals. Adding another law to the statute books wouldn't be too arduous.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest08-Choice01Objective">Have $Amount01Name or more Active Laws in your Empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest08-Choice01ObjectiveTooltip">Ensure you have the necessary Support and Influence to enact any given law</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest08-Choice01Outcome">The secret cabal was probably nothing more than paranoia based off groundless rumors, but the outcome has been very beneficial to your empire. You look forward to directing your new population's efforts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest09-IntroTitle">The Cosmos Unborn</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest09-IntroDescription">A powerful cult within the $MinorFactionName civilization believe that eldritch, nightmarish kin once traversed the galaxy. Although these kin have now ascended to a higher plane of existence, the cultists are convinced that relics of their culture still exist in ancient ruins scattered across the stars. Fossilized remains. Umbilicals. Placentas. Cerebral cortices. One especially maniacal cultist confesses that the relics aren't simply dead heirlooms. They are artefacts of great--and deadly--power.
The relics are likely worthless scraps, but if you acquired them for the $MinorFactionName, they could give you a great deal of influence . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest09-Choice01Description">Ancient relics certainly still exist among the stars. An expedition with a sufficiently experienced Hero should be able to bring back remnants that will convince the $MinorFactionName.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest09-Choice01Outcome">The expedition did well. Although cautious at first, the $MinorFactionName cultists soon believed they held the remains of ancient kin. In turn, this bolstered their political standing, and they soon came to power. Assimilation into your empire followed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest10-IntroTitle">At The Altar of Ancient Gods</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest10-IntroDescription">Ever since they can remember, the $MinorFactionName have attached divine significance to a distant blood-red star in their night sky. To some the star is a symbol of the crucible of fire that will one day consume the universe, to others it is a symbol of the fire of creation. In either case, every year the $MinorFactionName celebrate the star's existence through the Burning Light Festival which last three whole days and nights.
Now that the age of contact has come upon the $MinorFactionName, they would be grateful if you could send a pilgrimage to the star, so that their most learned scholars can pay all their respects.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest10-Choice01Description">It is true that we sometimes forget the incredible power of the fiery beacons that light up the endless darkness, that are the ultimate origin of all life.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest10-Choice01Outcome">The $MinorFactionName pilgrims are returned to their people possessing a deep spiritual connection with the cosmos. They vow to carry the flame through the generations--and are deeply thankful for the part you played.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest11-IntroTitle">The Lost Battalion</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest11-IntroDescription">The soldiers died long ago, but their sacrifice is not forgotten.
Two centuries past, the $MinorFactionName were visited by a starfaring race. Descending in elegant craft possessed of powers indistinguishable from magic, the alien beings stepped onto the $MinorFactionName homeworld. Though communication was difficult, the visitors explained very calmly what they wanted of the $MinorFactionName : Two hundred soldiers destined to battle on a distant toxic world far from their loved ones--and die a certain, but honorable, death.
It is necessary was all the visitors offered by word of explanation.
Generations later, with your help, the $MinorFactionName are finally able to visit the fields of war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest11-Choice01Description">With Titanium protective suits, a $MinorFactionName party will be able to visit the battlefield where their ancestors fell. It is the least you can do.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest11-Choice01Outcome">The $MinorFactionName dignitaries return to their homeworld somber and reflective. You can tell how much the visit means to them by the way they clasp your arm and the look in their eyes. You are sure they will be useful allies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest12-IntroTitle">Patient Zero</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest12-IntroDescription">A devastating disease outbreak is currently running rampant through the $MinorFactionName home system. Thousands have already succumbed to the infection, and tens of thousands more are sick. Everyday life is close to breaking point: critical industries are scraping by with skeleton crews, medical facilities are overrun with the unwell, and food shortages loom. Civil unrest is likely to soon spillover into outright rebellion.
As $MinorFactionName leaders attempt to manage the outbreak, one vital question remains unanswered: where did the disease originate? Tracing the outbreak back to its inception and identifying patient zero could well be the discovery that breaks the plague's stranglehold.
While $MinorFactionName scientists establish the identity of patient zero, the $MinorFactionName have asked if you can provide immediate relief for fleeing refugees.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest12-Choice01Description">A swift building program to house, employ, and care for the $MinorFactionName refugees will be greatly appreciated, and could be useful for the future in any case.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest12-Choice01Objective">Build $Amount01Name or more Buildings in your Empire within $Timer [turn].</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest12-Choice01Outcome">The building program was a success! Thousands of $MinorFactionName escaped destitution or worse on account of the new constructions. The $MinorFactionName leadership are incredibly grateful for your help, and more than happy to be assimilated into your empire. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest13-IntroTitle">Flight of the Prototype</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest13-IntroDescription">The $MinorFactionName government have a problem.
They are adamant that sleeper agents of unknown origins--possibly Mavros or Pilgrim-controlled--have infiltrated their highest R&amp;D facilities, and will shortly instigate strategic attacks on their most sophisticated spacecraft prototype.
In a dimly-lit hangar in the heart of a top-secret underwater facility, the $MinorFactionName representative shows you the craft.
"The only way we can ensure our technology is protected is by entrusting it to your care while we root out the spies."
The craft is beautiful blend of aesthetics and engineering; it would be a tragedy if it was destroyed. And the $MinorFactionName would be extremely grateful too . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest13-Choice01Description">Protecting the $MinorFactionName's prototype craft shouldn't be too difficult. It might be best to merge it with a fleet though.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest13-Choice01Objective">Ensure the $MinorFactionName's prototype ship survives in-flight for at least $Amount01Name [turn].</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest13-Choice01ObjectiveTooltip">The ship cannot be sent to a Hangar, as this risks enemy infiltration.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest13-Choice01Outcome">The $MinorFactionName representative has sent word: all enemy spies have been captured.
With the prototype craft still safe in your hands, the $MinorFactionName are happy to bring their whole civilization under your protective wing. And as a bonus, they tell you to keep the prototype craft.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest14-IntroTitle">My Superyacht Is Bigger Than Yours</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest14-IntroDescription">Maybe it shouldn't be a surprise. The family dynasty that currently controls the $MinorFactionName empire are "new money", hailing from a trio of photogenic celebrity siblings who accumulated much power a generation ago. Now their spoilt offspring wield the reins of power like they're running a glitzy gameshow rather than a serious civilization.
It does, however, reveal a chink in their diplomatic armor.
An unhappy $MinorFactionName attaché, suffering the family's vanities in the Intrasolar Office, assures you that if you rock up to their system in a suitably militarily pimped-out vessel, you will gain their immediate respect, and probably their loyalty too. The attaché hopes that the assimilation of the $MinorFactionName into your empire will eventually lead to a change of leadership.
He really is that desperate.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest14-Choice01Description">What harm can it do? Sounds like a win-win situation. Get a lean mean killing machine, and bring down some jumped-up $MinorFactionName dynasty in the process.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest14-Choice01Objective">Create a ship with at least $Amount01Name Offensive Power and bring it to the System $MinorHomeSystemName.</LocalizationPair>

As predicted, you're primetime--and the toast of the brattish leadership. Within a week the $MinorFactionName are part of the fold.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest15-IntroTitle">Diplomatic Chicanery</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest15-IntroDescription">After the first official contact with the $MinorFactionName, you are somewhat surprised when you receive a crumpled note a few days later. The leader wants a secret meeting with you, away from any prying eyes. Curious, you agree.
After your personal bodyguards have scoped out the location, you meet the $MinorFactionName leader in the shadows.
"I'll get straight to the matter," the leader says. "I have a weakness. For gambling. Skimmer racing to be precise." The $MinorFactionName steps closer, stepping into a shaft of light. "I owe a lot of Dust."
"And? What's this to me?" you reply.
"Build me a new track complex--exclusive, opulent, high-spec. Somewhere close, but . . . well hidden--and I'll give you the keys to the kingdom."</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest15-Choice01Description">The thought of an underground racing site on a virgin world in one of your systems appeals greatly. Especially if it brings the $MinorFactionName into the fold. Maybe you'll even have a flutter yourself.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest15-Choice01Objective">Take control of a planet in a new system adjacent to $MinorHomeSystemName</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest15-Choice01ObjectiveTooltip">You can set up an Outpost, trade for it diplomatically, or Invade to take control of a new system.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest15-Choice01Outcome">With the final touches being put to the skimmer racing complex, you give the $MinorFactionName leader a guided tour of the site. Afterwards, they cannot hide their excitement.
"Your architects and course designers are among the finest in the galaxy. This place will give me much pleasure, and hopefully many winnings!" The $MinorFactionName presents an ornate key on a sequined cushion. "As promised, the key to the kingdom."</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest-Failed">The $MinorFactionName have decided your assistance in this matter is not needed at this time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest16-IntroTitle">Masters of the Arena</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest16-IntroDescription">The sun beats down, sweltering, and sweat prickles your brow. The noisy bloodlust of the crowd together with the dry dust churned up by the combatants, suffocates too.
For a dizzying moment, you wonder what possessed you to accept the $MinorFactionName leader's invitation to their bloodsports arena, but then you remember: you court their civilization, and hope these are necessary steps towards the $MinorFactionName's assimilation into your empire.
Far below, a fighter in golden scale neatly rolls to one side through the sand, and impales the last of the tri-headed mechanical snakes. The beast slumps to the ground, electricity crackling over its metallic form, and the crowd roars their approval.
The leader leans close, its smell powerful and unpleasant. "That's my Finance Minister. He lives and breathes economics--but first and foremost, he's a warrior." The $MinorFactionName lowers its voice. "Show me your passion for violence, and you will have our loyalty,"</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest16-Choice01Description">Demonstrating your civilization's militarism shouldn't be too difficult--you just hope you don't have to go to war to prove your colors.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest16-Choice01Objective">Raise your [militaristColored] #B82738#Militarist#REVERT# support to at least 30% in $Amount01Name Systems</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest16-Choice01Outcome">The $MinorFactionName leader sends their congratulations upon learning of the swell towards militarism across your Empire. The $MinorFactionName are now happy to join your empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest17-IntroTitle">Happy Days</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest17-IntroDescription">It has been a difficult few years for the $MinorFactionName. Civil wars, natural disasters, and industrial decline has led to a planet-wide feeling of melancholy among the population. Walking through the capital city, the place quiet and subdued, a lone $MinorFactionName approaches, but your guards block her way.
"If you'll permit me, Your Excellency?"
You nod. The guards step aside, and the $MinorFactionName joins your side. You walk on together.
"You are the leader of a mighty empire, are you not? And you want us to join your empire, don't you?"
"Perhaps."
"Then what you must do, is show that your people are content." You stop at the edge of a great plaza, but rather than the colorful life you might expect in the heart of the capital, you find shuttered stalls, watching eyes, and silence. "A deep and strong happiness is what the $MinorFactionName seek most. Show us that and our masters will elect to join you. Trust me, I know."
The $MinorFactionName slips away.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest17-Choice01Description">Later discussions with the $MinorFactionName leadership, together with analysis by your top xeno-psychologists, suggest that the stranger spoke the truth. Keep your own people content, and the $MinorFactionName will join you.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest17-Choice01Outcome">The enigmatic stranger was indeed right. After demonstrating the deep, abiding contentedness that sat deep in your people's souls, the $MinorFactionName agreed to join you. They are hopeful for a brighter future under your wing. One day you hope to meet the stranger again--you feel she could play a larger role in  your empire's future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest18-IntroTitle">The Light of Other Worlds</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest18-IntroDescription">For centuries the $MinorFactionName have gazed at the heavens and wondered what mysteries their nearest star systems held. Did these worlds hold stunning natural wonders, riches beyond their wildest dreams, and weird and wonderful alien life? Or were they simply dead worlds filled the dusty tombs of long-gone civilizations and dormant monsters that should never be disturbed?
The question still tightly grips the $MinorFactionName imagination today. In fact, one of the biggest schisms in their society is concerned with the question of what exactly resides in their own constellation. Some caution reticence, afraid of what demons they might unleash, while others agitate to learn more about their corner of the cosmos. Deadlocked, the $MinorFactionName are paralyzed.
Perhaps you can help?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest18-Choice01Description">Exploring the constellation of the $MinorFactionName on their behalf should be relatively straightforward, and could generate some nice discoveries, not to mention earning the eternal gratitude of the $MinorFactionName people.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionQuest18-Choice01Outcome">The galaxy is still an intimidating place to many $MinorFactionName but with the information you have relayed to them about the ruins, landscapes, flora and fauna, and hazards of their nearby star systems, they feel more confident about stepping out further into the galaxy. Especially as it will now be under your wing. </LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical01Description">A listening outpost on the far edge of your territory has picked up a garbled communication, and sends an urgent message up the chain of command. Someone is leaking military secrets to a rival empire, and could jeopardize upcoming offensive operations. 
The message and its origins are unclear, but a digital forensics team is able to pinpoint one clue: that the attached files contain metadata originating from the terminal of an artillery officer of one of your Minor Civilizations.
The soldier's record is exceptional, but there have always been those who complained at allowing an outsider to rise so high in military command . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical01Choice01Title">Start Trial</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical01Choice02Title">Refuse Trial</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical01Choice02Description">You take the officer at his word, and order a more thorough investigation into the leak--but as soon as word gets around that you won't prosecute the man, a number of your military quit in protest. 
Coincidentally, the intelligence team reports the traffic they were monitoring has suddenly gone silent . . . but with no more evidence, it will be impossible to root out the traitor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical02Title">Trial By Fire: Part 2</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical02Description">The artillery officer's trial spirals out of control. Nationalists within your empire argue it was a mistake to ever empower an outsider within your military. In turn, those accusations outrage minorities across your population and their allies who have pledged loyalty to your cause. 
The officer is convicted, but maintains his innocence and begs you to expand your investigation. He recalls reviewing the stolen intelligence as a routine operations check, and that he forwarded it to several other officers for review. 
Protests against the officer's arrest have begun on several worlds, and public action is needed to sway the mood of the public . . .

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical02Choice01Title">Shutdown Protests</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical03Title">Trial By Fire: Part 3</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical03Description">The artillery officer has been convicted. He sits in a prison facility nicknamed "The Reaper's Penthouse," as his lawyers file petition after petition for his freedom. The minor factions in your empire live in a permanent state of fury. 
Things can't seem to get any worse, but somehow, they do. An intergalactically renowned journalist named Zolya Emily publishes an intrepid report damning your entire government, and exposing the real traitor as an Admiral who the officer consulted on the reports.
Emily's work rocks the empire, ironically making allies out of the minor factions and their former enemies. Though the officer is happy to have his name cleared, there will be a price to pay for your administration's bumbling efforts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical03Choice01Title">Reap What You Sow</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical03Choice01Description">Your attempts to use strong-arm politics to force the issue have spectacularly backfired.

Healing these divisions will take time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical04Title">Boiler Room</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical04Description">Lobbyists for your empire's banks have been assailing your Senators for weeks with demands to ease some of the regulations on their operations. In particular, they're requesting looser restrictions on letting ordinary citizens in space travel ventures, and on insuring ships heading out for long distance voyages.
They promise increased financial gains for your Empire, with minimal risks to your financial future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical04Choice01Title">Approve</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical04Choice01Description">A free market does benefit from being more . . . free, and space travel is a lucrative economy booster at the moment. Perhaps some relief for the bankers would be financially prudent. </LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical04Choice02Description">These deregulations are maddening, and nakedly put the lives of the people at risk in order to possibly raise profits for the banks' financial systems. End this madness before it starts and raise taxes on their operations as a warning not to try this again!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical05Title">Boiler Room - Part 2</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical05Description">It turns out allowing bankers to deregulate their own industry may not have been a fantastic idea. One of the larger banks tied up its clients' wealth in a set of risky trade voyages, but pirates intercepted the merchant fleets and stole everything they carried. 
Worse still, the insurance claims on the ships mean yet more Dust is funneled out of the public's funds, and the large shipping corporations are the only ones reimbursed for their loss. 
Your people are penniless, broke, and rioting. The bankers are begging for more time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical05Choice01Title">Grant More Time</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical05Choice01Description">You grit your teeth at reading the increasingly insane measures they propose to fix this economy without executive action.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical05Choice02Title">Jail Bankers</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical05Choice02Description">It's financially painful, but you opt to cut this problem off before it gets any worse. These idiots can't be trusted to run a small spaceport, let alone an intergalactic banking operation. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical06Title">Smoking Gun - Part 1</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical06Description">With the elections approaching, you've begun to take note of the growing support for minority parties within your government. 
Your aides have given you conflicting reports on the causes. Some try to argue it's a matter of policy views, age gaps, and changing values, but the arrests of several high-profile legislators, charged with spying for the enemy, means there may be a bigger picture at stake.
A group of mercenaries approaches you, spies who claim expertise in getting results done without getting caught. If you hire them, they claim they could root out the conspirators, and tip the election in your favor . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical06Choice01Title">Hire Spies</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical06Choice01Description">Their prices are high but their information is good. You'll need all the help you can get to save your administration from the corruption within. </LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical07Title">Smoking Gun - Part 2</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical07Description">The mercenaries were able to bug the opposing party's offices and provide valuable intelligence, but things have taken a turn for the worse. On a repeat surveillance sortie, the group is spotted by an unarmed security guard, and law enforcement descends on the entire group.
You've paid them well, so they don't out the entire administration, but ties to your party are published in the press. If heads don't start rolling, the people may begin to question your entire government . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical07Choice01Title">Fire Leaders</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical07Choice01Description">Someone has to take the fall for this--eliminating leaders of your party will weaken faith in your administration but bring an end to this farce of an election.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical07Choice02Description">Stun the people and use this opportunity to defend the needs of an aggressive government, one that will go to any length to protect its people from outside conspirators. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical08Title">Smoking Gun - Part 2</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical08Description">The arrest of the spies creates something of a scandal, but during the public trial your skillful political testimony convinces the majority of your population that your government is a shining beacon of light in a sea of darkness.
The subsequent execution of the spies demonstrates that, despite being bound by the truth, you are no soft touch either.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical08Choice01Title">Honest Policy</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical08Choice01Description">Your blend of idealism and discipline resonates with the population, who sing your praises. You should make the most of this upsurge in your popularity while it lasts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical09Title">A Million Things I Haven't Done</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical09Description">Conflict has broken out between two of your trusted advisors. Two war heroes, once dearest friends, have nearly come to blows over the management of the Industrial party. They trade insults in the press, and don't print retractions. 
One, a young upstart who has made enemies and allies with his decisive decision-making, argues the party should adopt more taxes and tariffs in order to regulate the empire's debts. 
The other, a fine negotiator but dedicated opportunist, cautions against bold action and worries about the government's relationship with large businesses and foreign empires if such acts are taken.
Their argument is as much personal as it is professional--whichever advisor you back will have plenty of ammo to throw at the other as their rivalry continues.
</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical09Choice01Title">Back Upstart</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical09Choice01Description">This upstart believed for the longest time his only way to rise up was on the battlefield in glory--rewarding his plan will show the people there's more to life then being a martyr. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical09Choice02Title">Back Opportunist</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical09Choice02Description">The opportunist's motives may consistently disgust you, but there is reason in his words. You might favor him on this occasion. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical10Title">A Million Things I Haven't Done (Part2)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical10Description">The upstart's success has only emboldened his political ambitions, and raised his standing with the public. He campaigns to run for head of the treasury, and wins in a landslide. Now one of the most loved and hated leaders in your empire holds the keys to the vault.

His rivals can't tolerate this. They've thrown everything they've got against him, but even infidelity charges don't stick. The opportunist, however, sees one last chance to bring him down.

In a rare stroke of boldness, he insults the upstart's family, in particular, the man's dead son, who was accidentally killed in a fight while military training.

The upstart is furious, and demands satisfaction in the form of a duel.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical10Choice01Title">Encourage Duel</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical10Choice01Description">Let them work out this petty quarrel on their own. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical10Choice02Title">Discourage Duel</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical10Choice02Description">What foolishness is this? You can't have two of your top officials killing each other over insults and pride. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical13Title">The Division</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical13Description">The tense political rivalry between Militarism and Pacifism in the $SystemName system has risen to emergency levels: the Militarist faction has ordered the construction of an intricate, system-spanning barricade between $SystemName's inner and outer planets. Intra-system movement has been severely restricted, and many citizens have been cut off from their families and friends. The Pacifist "inner" planets have petitioned you for help.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical13Choice01Title">Ignore</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical13Choice01Description">A blockade serves a useful purpose: it has put a stop to the infighting and congressional spats that have plagued $SystemName for years. Leaving the system temporarily divided will allow each half to do what they do best, without getting in the other's way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical13Choice02Title">Dismantle</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical13Choice02Description">Through experience, you know that this sort of division only leads to trouble. You must tear down this barricade.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical14Title">The Division: Part 2</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical14Description">The situation in $SystemName, your divided system, has gone from bad to worse. The Militarist portion has implemented stringent and oppressive laws, and violent demonstrations have erupted in several major cities. Meanwhile, your Pacifist portion is suffering from a sluggish industry and economy. The two portions of your system have developed different flags and national identities. At this point, you have no idea what would happen if you were to forcefully take down the barricade.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical14Choice01Title">Ignore</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical14Choice01Description">Perhaps it was a mistake to leave the barricade up, but it's probably best to leave things where they lie now. The independent halves of your system can work things out peacefully on their own--and the barricade may now be the only thing keeping $SystemName from civil war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical14Choice02Title">Dismantle</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical14Choice02Description">The political situation is very unstable, but you feel you must give orders for the barricade to be taken down immediately. $SystemName used to live in peace--how did this all happen so quickly?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical15Title">A Two-Way Street</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical15Description">The recent switch to Industrialist politics in $SystemName has left many unhappy. Chief among the dissidents is a radical splinter group, who have begun raiding shipping lanes to disrupt economic activity. The governor has imprisoned the worst of the offenders, and plans to deactivate several established, historically-significant space stations to build a network of newer, cheaper, secure waypoint systems for intra-system travel.
The people have voted against his proposal, citing historical and cultural value. The decision falls to you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical15Choice01Title">Approve</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical15Choice01Description">The orbital stations are indeed old, and the new waypoint network would give your system an economic boost, as well as discouraging terrorist attacks. The sentimental citizens of $SystemName will just have to accept things.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical15Choice02Title">Veto</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical15Choice02Description">If the people voted to preserve the space stations, they should certainly not be destroyed. It will be a little harder for the governor to implement his plan, and perhaps the system but will suffer a few more dissident attacks, but ultimately the people should decide what their home system looks like, not you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical16Title">Down To Earth</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical16Description">Appointing a Religious Senator without popular support has proven to be a troublesome decision. The latest developments involve the controversial choice to ban moxotl, an aquiferous plant harvested across the empire and often added to drinks for its temporary gravity-altering properties.
The trouble is, moxotl isn't just recreational--it's also used in industry and medical treatments. Banning it for religious reasons, lobbyists say, is nothing more than a flight of fancy. What do you say?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical16Choice01Title">Uphold</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical16Choice01Description">You just recently installed this governor in office--you can't undermine their choices so soon. Let the ban stand.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical16Choice02Title">Remove</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical16Choice02Description">Perhaps vetoing this particular ban will improve the people's Approval--and give the impression that you're actively listening to them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical17BisTitle">Generation Gamma</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical17BisDescription">Political disinterest among young people across the empire has reached an all-time high. The sons and daughters of a generation brought up with ideals of a perfect republic feel increasingly powerless and disenfranchised, as if they are just cogs in a machine. A common sentiment is that the electoral system is rigged against them.
Having pulled a few strings in the last election, you know they are not exactly wrong. But how will you deal with the problem?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical17BisChoice01Title">Conscript</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical17BisChoice01Description">One of the best remedies for a dissatisfied populace is war. By pulling a few more strings, you'll be able to unite the populace -- against a common enemy that may or may not really exist.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical17BisChoice02Title">Entertain</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical17BisChoice02Description">By cultivating a consumerist, entertainment-oriented society, you'll draw your people's attention away from the things that really matter. Read, watch, play -- and don't vote.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical17BisChoice03Title">Educate</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical17BisChoice03Description">So you cheated in the last election. That doesn't mean you'll do it again. By educating the people and encouraging them to exercise their rights as citizens, you'll empower the people -- and reap some other benefits as well.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical18Title">Progress</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical18Description">The new Industrialist movement on $SystemName is causing more problems than you would like. Apparently, some political organizations have been spearheading a civilian movement to "tear down the old," destroying valuable cultural monuments and priceless artifacts in an attempt to usher in a new industrial era. If this is allowed to continue, intellectualism and innovation on $SystemName will be crippled for decades to come. Still, the near-fanatical energy of this movement is doing wonders for the system's industry. What will you do?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical18Choice01Title">Stop</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical18Choice01Description">The movement is ridiculous, and must be put to a stop. It would be an awful waste if you allowed the people to cast off the lessons of history so carelessly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical18Choice02Title">Ignore</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical18Choice02Description">A certain casting off of the past is important for progress. Unless the movement reaches dangerous levels, it should be allowed to take its natural course.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical19Title">The Food of Lab</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical19Description">Your scientists are making progress on an interesting research project: a type of gene therapy that permanently reduces a person's need for food.

It's risky, they say, and will consume a large amount of food stores, but could pave the way for a breakthrough within two generations.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical19AltTitle">Message from Coroz</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical19AltDescription">You have received a message from Coroz, home dimension of the Riftborn. A group of scientists have had their facilities destroyed by the advancing blight, and are unable to continue their work. They have applied to join your empire in New Coroz as laborers until they can resume their jobs back home as scientists.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical19AltChoice01Title">Rebuild</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical19AltChoice01Description">Instead of taking them on as laborers, you should divert some of your resources to help them rebuild as quickly as possible. Every moment not studying the blight is a moment it threatens more of your home.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical19AltChoice02Title">Accept</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical19AltChoice02Description">You will miss the scientific work they are doing, but your empire could use a temporary boost in productivity. Utilizing your resources to the fullest is what the Riftborn do best.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical20Title">The Quantitative Society</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical20Description">A cabal of scientists and visionaries from a prominent research group/think tank have come forward to your government promising to deliver the dream of a utopian society. They have created a vast super-AI that can watch and learn from all, and believe that all will benefit from its scrutiny. Like many who have come up with ideas to "fix" society, their dream is riddled with their own biases and hang-ups, including believing that life isn't worth living without a dependable chain of caffeine bars featuring semi-designer furnishings and "exotic" mood music. The fact their vision of a perfect society also involves mandatory science "fun" means that although your citizens will become more rational, they won't be as pliant. A more popular, less scientifically beneficial move, would be to ignore them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical20Choice01Title">Embrace</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical20Choice01Description">They might be over-trendy, but the visionaries have a point. An invasive, pervasive monitoring system ran by an AI supermind is a small price to pay for a boost to science!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical20Choice02Title">Reject</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical20Choice02Description">By ramping up the focus on the infringement of basic rights that the AI system will entail, the rejection of the eggheads' plan can provide a major boost to your popularity. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical21Title">Unnatural Wastelands</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical21Description">An undercover documentary concerning a makeshift community who live in one of your planet's biggest refuse facilities has become a loaded political issue. Many are scraping a living in the system's dumps, scavenging for recycled materials while setting up their homes in the very same places. Amenities have followed, and these places are now lively, if polluted and dangerous, hubs.
Environmental groups demand that action is taken, that industries need to manage their resources better, and not fuel these communities.
Others suggest going even further, and monetizing these places more effectively. In essence, they advocate greater ties between industry and the refuse sites.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical21Choice01Title">Shutdown</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical21Choice01Description">These dumps are a stain on your civilization. Industry might suffer, but you have a moral imperative to ensure the welfare of your whole population. Forecasting suggests that happiness will increase.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical21Choice02Title">Enhance</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical21Choice02Description">When in doubt, double down! Sure industry could throw away less stuff, but maybe they could throw away more stuff and be even more efficient. Then we get more thriving dump economies too, even if many don't like it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical22Title">Tete-a-Tete</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical22Description">$SystemName, a major industrial hub for your empire, is holding a fancy summit for industry leaders and politicians to mingle and "talk business" away from the scrutiny of the public eye. This year, ecological groups have organized a massive protest, condemning the summit as a secretive way to pass elitist, eco-unfriendly laws.
You've just received your personal invitation to the party.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical22Choice01Title">Condemn</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical22Choice01Description">Industry is important, but the people are right: sneaky politics are no way to run a system. The summit will go on this time, but not with your support, and speaking publicly against it will ease the hearts of many.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical22Choice02Title">Attend</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical22Choice02Description">Business is business, and this is the way business has always been done on $SystemName. You'd be foolish to run off your mouth about it now. Besides—those industry leaders do know how to throw a good party.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical23Title">In Memory Of</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical23Description">You've never heard of him, but a mystical figure, Kalant Alcor, has recently passed away and begun his ascent up "The Divine Ladder" to another plane of existence. A religious bloc in your Senate demand that Alcor's passing be given a full state funeral, with a hundred thousand votive candles lit in every city, special monuments constructed that feature his idiosyncratic writings, and three days of empire-wide mourning. It'll be expensive, but Alcor was a popular figure, and your population will be grateful. On the other hand, political models suggest that a rejection of the demand will boost scientific literacy even if it is unpopular. After all, much of Alcor's writings concern the truth that worlds are flat not round.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical23Choice01Title">Neglect</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical23Choice01Description">Kalant Alcor was a fraud and a liar, gaining a cult reputation through manipulation and hatred. To give him a officially endorsed funeral of such magnitude would not only be costly, it would be a blow against progress.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical23Choice02Title">Honor</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical23Choice02Description">So the guy had some interesting theories about the way the cosmos worked. Who cares? He probably inspired creatives. It might cost the treasury a little, but afterwards your citizens are going to be extremely grateful. And, more importantly, malleable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical24Title">Church and State</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical24Description">You are pleased, but not entirely surprised, to discover that one of your colonies has developed a fringe religion in which the central deity... is you. Though small, it has already drawn a following. One of their more charismatic leaders has publicly asked if you would bless them with an appearance at the inauguration of their newest cathedral.
Meanwhile, others in that system are watching to see what your response will be.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical24Choice01Title">Accept</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical24Choice01Description">You haven't visited $SystemName in a while; no harm taking in a little adoration while you're at it. Besides, it'll help cement your political influence over the sector.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical24Choice02Title">Decline</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPolitical24Choice02Description">Mixing religion and politics is a bad, bad idea. To ensure your empire stays on the proper path, you must decline. You want an empire that looks outward at the wonders of the universe, not inward at its own navel.</LocalizationPair>
